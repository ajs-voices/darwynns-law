I spent the night with Sage and for the first time since I've slept here with him I'm up at 4:30 in the morning.  Chalk it up to anxiety, more so than nightmares.  I woke up, well I got up so I wouldn't keep Sage up.  I have to be on a plane at 11:29am.  I'm so not looking forward to that.  I'm not looking forward to being away from Sage for 30 days.  This is such a weird experience.  I don't think Sage and I have been apart for more than a few days.  I have lunch with him most days, and breakfast some mornings.  And every Friday night I cook for him in his wonderful kitchen.

Last night we ate as a proper family, the three of us.  I even let Drake have ice cream before he had his dinner.  Sage wasn't happy.  But the little smile on the dragon's face was more than worth it.  And Sage was happy with dinner itself so it was all good in the end.

And after Drake went to bed I played with my hair.  I couldn't decide what to do.  I could be normal and leave it brown or just the blonde tips.  But then I don't think I'd feel comfortable in my own skin.  It's bad enough to camp out in the dirt and grime, but I like being me.  But I'm not afraid to get dirty.  I like camping as long as I can be me.  So I decided I would do variations of green and go with a camo look.  It looks pretty cool for the whole hiking thing.  It might be cool on a club night, but I don't think I want to do it often, it's not really me. I like the bright colors and since I met Sage I liked to keep it blue.

My nail polish is black, and I have a few bottles I'm taking with me - in case the bottles break.  Why don't I magic that like my hair?  Because it turns my nails that color, and that's not healthy and not quite so easy to change then.

I have a few change of clothes - not enough for 30 days, but hey I'm a guy.  And I can wash in a stream.  Or if I get really pressed for grime, I can hike back to the Boulder compound and do laundry in a real washing machine and dryer.  Though as a student that's considered cheating.  I could clean it with my ability.  And I'll probably do that a few times too.  But there is only so much my ability can do.

I'm sure I'm up for other reasons than this damned trip, but at least I'm not up because of my nightmares.  I have nightmares every night I don't spend with Sage.  He is my link to a good nights sleep and I treasure each night I get with him.  And I will miss him, but this is good for me - good for us.  I wonder if I'm too much to for Sage sometimes.  If I'm a burden.  I take more than I give.  I try to give back.  I try, but I'm not good at this.  I love him.  I never thought I could love someone so much.  I will do better.  I will.

I'm going to go for my last run before the trip.  Then I'm going to make my love his favorite breakfast and take my little dragon to school and then head to the airport.  I'm not looking forward to this - I hate flying.  I HATE flying.

I just left my love at security and now I'm sitting in an airport terminal waiting my flight.  The problem with being me, well one problem anyway is I hate being late.  I have to be early or exactly on time.  The latter is very hard to accomplish when the world doesn't follow my rules.  When it was just me I could make my appointments, but when I have to use other people, do other things with other people.  I have learned to be early in most things.  I need to be early so I have more than an hour before boarding the plane, which is also plenty of time to relax and not freak out about the plane ride about to take.  I hate flying.  The smells are so powerful.  The people are so close.  We are so high from the ground.  Dae'lin made sure I had an aisle seat.  But I wasn't sure how much that was going to help with so many people around and all the boys we are taking with us.

Right now I'm alone in the terminal.  Oh wait, here comes the rest of the team.  I expected everyone to sit someplace else.  What I didn't expect was for Nate, my nephew to be with the bunch or for Jason's nephew to either for that matter, Chris sat across the aisle from me while Dylan sat down next to me.  I should pause be social...



# Aug 15, 2015 @ 12:05 PM

Take off was a bitch.  It always is.  I had put my hands in my kangaroo pouch once we boarded the plane for the first time since leaving Sage at security.  Inside the pouch I found a little red dragon.  Mushu was supposed to sit on Sage's mantle piece and collect dust.  But my love stuck him in my pocket.  It's not the same as having the stuffed dragon, but I held the small toy in my fist the whole trip up to altitude before I could turn on my music and open up my laptop and start typing again.  Sage is the best, again he's always giving.  I have to find a way to repay him.

After Nate had sat down, Trent made Nate vacate his seat and sat down next to me.  Trent is one of Aaron's minions.  Lucky me.  I should have thught about that before coming on the trip.  Trent started out as usual.  "So you going to sleep with all the boys?"  

Dylan laughed and some of the boys around us bit back their laughter and others hid their fears.  I rolled my eyes and answered.  "I don't sleep with teenagers.  I have rules."  I got up from my seat and grabbed my small carry on bag.  Before I could walk away Dylan grabbed my wrist and smiled up at me.

He turned to Trent and laughed.  "Lover boy here has a boyfriend.  I'm pretty sure he's off the market."  He looked up at me with that perfect smile that every girl loved and several guys as well - including myself.  "Sit down, Nox.  Trent won't bother you again.  Or I'll get Michaela to beat the shit out of him again."

I grinned at the boy who'd grown into a decent man and I sat back down.  Trent got up and went to another aisle where there were a few boys chatting loudly.  Probably some of Aaron's crowd too.  He seemed to keep getting followers even after he'd graduated the Academy.  Like he never grew up and never left.

Dylan nodded towards Trent.  "You would think they'd grow up sometime."

I shrugged.  "Aaron's crew never grew up."

Dylan nodded.  "I know.  I did though."

"That's good to know.  No hard feelings then?"  I asked him.

He smiled at me.  "No.  Not anymore.  That kiss had a detrimental effect, but only to those girls who found it odd.  I did find a girl who didn't mind."

I knew he was dating Michaela.  Mick and I talked still, she actually asked for help once and awhile.  "Mich is a good girl, not much bothers her."

Dylan laughed.  "She liked you too."

"It was just sex.  Nothing serious."

"For you maybe.  For her it could have been more."

I sighed.  "I told Michaela from the beginning….

Dylan put his hand on my arm and nodded.  "I know.  She knows.  It was just a comment."

Our rows were called and our conversation ended.  I was seated with Nate and Chris.  And that made it really easy to drift into my own little world here where I could think.  Though my hands are a bit shaky still, and the stewards are coming through with drinks and snacks.  I think I'll go for now.

Landing was no more fun than taking off.  The trip in the bus from the airport to the Boulder HQ was uneventful.  The bus was loud as any teenage gathering of boys would be expected to be.  15 boys, and three senior Venatori all in one space.  I remember why I don't like these things.  But now I'm in my own room, I can still hear the boys with my hearing but that's not something I can do anything about.  I was able to focus on my yoga and relax after the plane ride.  My little red dragon watched from his perch on my bed.  I called Sage and we talked about Dylan.  And Trent.  

But really I was just glad to hear his voice.

Tomorrow we hike to camp and then the real fun begins.  It's been awhile since I've had to actually teach survival.  Actually I never have, not that I can't.  I mean I've helped Walker learn in the city, but out in the wilderness that's a different story.  It's a skill every child learns in the Academy, the same way the boys are doing now.  A group of 15 boys or 15 girls are taken out and they are thrown to the wolves.  Or another metaphor, they learn to sink or swim, trial by fire, whichever suits your needs.

Dylan has been nothing less than friendly, he even sat with me after we got off the plane while the others went to get their luggage.  I still had to get mine as well but I always have to get straight after a flight.  Anxiety is a bitch.    

It's sad when everything you own fits into one bag.  Well most of everything.  My clothes are not all here, but I have never owned much.  And most of it is all in my bag with me.

Sleep probably won't come easily and when it does I imagine that it will be fitful and I'll wake with nightmares.  Trent called lights out. And the I could hear the arguments.  Dylan just laughed and told them "Fine, 6am comes early."  

The lights all went out but after 20 minutes the boys all started being loud again.  Typical kids.  I should lie down.  I'll be up soon anyway.  This is going to be a rough few days.

My nightmares were worse than normal.  Thankfully the eyes were red and not blue or orange or even green of dragon who killed my sister.  That was a new one - Margo's green eyes staring back at me as the tentacles fell on my skin.  I didn't know I was afraid of Margo until that dream.  Maybe my avoidance of her has been that.  My father has been trying to talk to me about it all for the past few months, but I've been avoiding any conversation that starts with 'have you seen Margo?'.  So much so that Sage doesn't mention her name, but I know he's asking about it all the time.   And I know he's been talking to her about me.  I know Dorian and my father have been talking to her too.  The only thing that is good about that is that they care enough to make sure I'm not in need of a therapist.

Even Adrian is keeping tabs on my mental health.  He's can't really help me much, but he at least will make me see someone if he thinks it's needed.  And I know Sage is talking to him about it too.  Margo has tried for years to get me to change my habits around my therapy, I guess it took her betrayal for me to do that.

I managed a yoga workout in the wee hours this morning after m nightmares.  Some of the boys were still stumbling around.  They are going to regret it in an hour when we wake their asses up and they are drunk off their asses and hiking for most of the day to our camp site.

It is a 4 hour hike on a good day.  Today it looks like it's going to storm.  I can hear thunder in the distance.  We are going to get wet.  I should probably pick up a parka from commissary before we leave, would hate for my hair to have to be redone.  There is a shit kitchen down the hall, I need to make breakfast - it might be my last decent meal for a little while, until the boys learn to catch real food.  Hell, I might not have a decent meal for 30 days. Le sigh.

Looks like I have a little while to wait for the rest of the guys to show up and we can move on up to the next camp.  It's not a usual thing to do this so early in the learning, but I guess since this one is gone we have no choice in the matter. The fire was still going when I got there.  It had been going for a while, there was nothing left though.  I put the fire out.  A little air, water and earth and it was out.  There is little salvageable here.  I've looked through most of the ruins now.

The place smells like Drake.  It's kinda comforting sitting her in the trees waiting the rest of them.  The air is cool, but it's a little thin.  But it's crystal clear even with the smoke in the air it's perfect.  I missed the mountains.  But I couldn't do this everyday.  I let my senses go and I could feel everything.  There is no one around for miles.  I can hear the woodland creatures around me.  I can hear the crystal creek running nearby.  I can taste the smoke in the air.  The damp leaves smell a little rotten yet fertile.  It's heaven yet the scariest place on earth.  

The memories from here are not quite fond ones.  I loved my mother.  I guess I still do, but there are too many other painful things to go with her than that love it's buried deep down.  I say I hate her but to hate something is to care enough to do so.  I don't care enough.  I regret never telling her I forgive her and that I'm sorry I lit the curtains on fire.  I don't want to think about it.  I don't want to write too much more about it.  Hell I shouldn't dwell on it.  There is nothing I can do, my mother is dead.  Died in the infirmary we just left, and was injured not to far from the second camp we will head to.  Not a lot of good memories here - none at all.

I can hear the pack of boys thrashing through the woods.  I should yell at them!  Maybe I'll scare them instead… decisions.



# Aug 16, 2015 @ 9:55PM

The hike to the new camp site was rough - even for me and I'm in shape.  We hiked for another four hours.  After a quick lunch at the ruined camp we started out again.  Dylan called HQ from his satellite phone used for emergencies and told them about the fire and our new plans.  All protocol and all.  There was no time to set up camp everyone pretty much collapsed where they stood no dinner, no fires, and no tents.

We get to sleep under the stars.  All the boys teeth are chattering but I'm not.  My ability is a wonderful tool.  No fire needed.  I'll be up early again I'm sure.

Earlier Nate and Chris hunkered down next to me and they both smiled at me when I extended the warmth to them.  Chris' eyes grew wide unaware that I was cheating until that moment.  They had come because they were family, not because they knew I was cheating.  Both boys have been snoring rather loudly for the past 30 minutes so I doubt the light from my screen is bothering them any.

While we were hiking up here I got a chance to speak with all the boys.  Unlike Trent and Dylan I wanted to know the kids.  To know how best to help them through it.  So I spent some time with each of them - except Nate and Chris who I already know rather well.

James Green is the grandson of Mark Green.  He's a very weak Magnus - NNAe1.  He's 16 and a snob. He pretty much looked down on me despite his several inches shorter than me.  He felt he was better than me even at the tender age of 16.  I'm not ruling family - little did he know.  I should have wrapped him up in air and left him but I'm bigger than that now and I went on to the next kid.  

Brock Combs has long red hair and a dull pair of blue prominent eyes but he was built like a truck.  He played football.  The Academy let the jocks out to play in one of the local school districts to augment their teams.  Some of them like swimming they have their own teams, but there isn't enough boys to put together entire teams.  Brock was a linebacker and fairly decent at it according to him.  He also had a heavy Texan accent, so he was likely missing home.  He had three years left before that was likely to happen.

Matthew Davenport, Matt - he insisted I call him that.  He kept looking at me like I was out of one of Sage's comic books.  He was quiet and shy and had the most unusual colored eyes - amber - I'd say almost the color of a wolf's.  I could tell by the way he held himself people picked on him and I could also see the small glimmer that he was checking me out.  I made sure not to make any grand overtures but told him if he needed to talk I was there.  

Carl Chong was one of the newer recruits at the tender age of 13. HIs eyes were the color of storm clouds and he work a heavy metal t-shirt.  His hair was spiked up and had fallen flat in the rain.  I forgot to mention it had rained most of the day as I had said it would.  Most of the kids were drenched from head to to, but only Carl's hair looked bad, and I was pretty sure he was still tasting all the goop he'd put in.  I was thankful for not styling my own.  I would not be doing that for most of our stay out in the woods.

The moment I approached Philip Maclin I regretted it.  Talk about a boy who likes to kiss ass.  He complimented my hair, my nails.  He said sweet things about Drake.  At the very least the boy had done his homework.  He knew who I was. Who my family was.  He knew as much as Nate and Chris did and he even knew things they didn't.  Things that required searching the Archives for.  Things I wished he hadn't - like the fact that I had a twin sister.  Apparently that was in the Archives.  I think it was about time I looked into my past - see what other mysteries of my birth might linger in the endless reaches of the Venatori paperwork.

Timothy Kitterman and Matt seemed like they should be friends, but yet when the two boys looked at each other I saw anger and passion that could only come from a breakup.  Where Matt had been shy Timothy was outgoing and peppy and was no wonder he was a cheerleader.  I watched him glide over the rocks that had fallen on our path long ago, and were never removed.  Rock climbing being something the boys needed to learn anyway.  

Patrick Vaughn was friends with Nate.  I'd seen the boy hanging around Iris' a time or two when I'd stop by for tea with my sister.  Other than Nick, she was the only one who really had accepted me as her little brother.  Patrick was into computers and video games.  He was one of few Venatori who might actually like living in the real world.  I would need to tell Dorian about him.  Make sure he got the proper education.  Maybe even introduce him to Sage.  It would be beneficial for the Venatori to start pursuing the computer arts among our own people who actually enjoy it.  I was already pressuring Nate to go to NYU and study Computer Science.  His mother was not interfering in that, but his father was a different story.

John Stone, like James Green, is one of the ruling families, and thus very high and mighty.  He is the grandson of Stephanie Stone, but he at least gave me a few moments of his precious time as I helped him scale over those same rocks Timothy gracefully slide over only moments before.  I think if he got away from James, he'd thrive and make new friends.

I know we are going to have a problem with Jerry Mora, but not for any of the social reasons, or any of the physical reasons.  The boy never takes his nose out of a book.  He literally, almost walked off the edge of a cliff.  I commandeered his current book only to have him reading another one an hour later.  I took his bag from him, and his book and he grumped at me.  Trent decided I was too weak to carry both Jerry's bage and my own and took the boy's bag.  I guess I'm okay with big macho men doing the heavy lifting but I take offense that I can't hold my own.  I can hold more than he ever dreamed of if push ever came to shove.  Just because I have to use my ability doesn't make me weak.

Michael Cox has long black hair that covers his gorgeous blue eyes - they remind me of Sage's, though not quite so bright.  He's always looking down, never met my eyes once even though he looked at me through those long black locks.  He was your typical goth kid - eyeliner and everything.  Though he looked like a member of Kiss with the black mascara running down his face after the rain.  I was glad the eyeliner I used was waterproof.  No black racoon eyes and dripping makeup for me.

Of the three left, Larry Donohue, was the least likely to do well.  He was a self described band geek.  He played tuba, flute, guitar and the piano and he was continuously beating against my seat on the bus ride up to Boulder from the airport.  Annoying.  But he at least paid attention.

Steven Lusby sat at the edge of everything.  He was last on the plane, last on the bus, he was last in line on the hike.  He didn't speak to anyone.  He didn't seem shy when I spoke to him.  Just didn't seem to want to be part of anything.  It made me wonder if this is what I looked like when I was a boy.  Though if I think back on it.  I never really let people take their eyes off of me.  I hated the center of attention, but if they were looking at the absurd things - like the hair and makeup and the 'yes I like boys' they were less likely to see the frightened little boy who was walking around thinking about hurting himself.  And once I started the whole pay attention to me, it was hard to stop.  I was the class clown, I got in trouble for talking too much, though I was never really talking to anyone around me, just talking.  

It's probably why this whole journal thing works so well for me.  I just get to ramble away for no apparent reason and no one has to actually listen to me.  But you are right?

Last but not least is Robert York.  Now let me tell you about Bob.  Yes, I'm calling him Bob.  Why, because it pisses him off.  Why, do i want to piss him off, because he's a drama queen.  He whines, he is a tattle tale.  In the 20 minutes I spent with him I learned that Lusby was crying last night, Matt and Tim had indeed dated and were on the bad end of a breakup,  and Philip was a stalker - he'd gotten in trouble several times for following several girls into the girls dorms.

All in all we had a pretty diverse group, with different backgrounds, different interests and it was going to take a lot to get them to work together as a team.  There would be three.  Dylan had yet to tell us exactly who was heading up which boys.  That was for tomorrow's morning wake up call.  

I should go to bed.  I will be up in a few hours anyway and probably right back here writing.



# Aug 17, 2015 @ 4:30AM

I'm up.  I didn't bring my sketchbook with me, so this will have to be my nightmare therapy for now.  I hate waking up with my heart in my throat and feeling like it's going to burst out of my chest.  I didn't even try to look at my back this morning, I could feel the drying blood and healed myself before I woke anyone else up with my night time whimpers.  Sleeping with someone I found out my nightmares are actually not so placid as I thought.  Sage says even when he's there, they are violent.  But what he considers violent and what I do I think are two different things.  I have never woken up bloodied by my own hand while lying in his bed, in his arms.  Whimpering and tossing are nothing compared to what I must look like on a bad night.  

I learned a long time ago that it's best to wear red or black to bed.  My sheets at home are a light color, but the miracles of bleach are a great thing.  I don't hide it at home, as I clean up my own space.  But out here, it's best to hide it.  I don't want strange boys or Trent and Dylan to know how badly things get.  

So when Dylan found me washing up in the stream near by I had to play it off.  He asked, "You rise early."

I only shrugged, there was a slight twinge to my shoulders where the skin was still a little raw.  Healing without a mirror wasn't ideal but I did the best I could with the tools I had.  "Best to get clean out of the prying eyes of the others."

Dylan rolled his eyes in the dim light of my glowing ball that hung above my head.  "Sensitive to others?"

I shook my head.  "I doubt the boys are ready to see the scars real hunters get when the monsters don't behave as they expect."

"I've heard about your back.  What did it?"

That was the one truth the Venatori don't ever need to hear, so I lied.  "There are some pretty evil creatures out there.  Thankfully this one underestimated me."  It wasn't a lie really, just didn't reveal anything at all, but Dylan laughed and waded into the water wearing only his boxers.  I asked, "Morning swim.  Seems I'm not the only one stuck to habits."

Dylan laughed.  "Hiking is all well and good, but there is nothing like the feel of the water."

I nodded knowingly, "I feel the same about running and yoga.  I won't be doing much running here, at least not the kind I'm used to but I'm gonna do my thing here, by the water, hope you don't mind."

Dylan shook his head.  "Be my guest, swimming with a light is always a good thing."  He nodded towards my little trick with a smile and started swimming the length of the narrow pool of water that we used for baths.  The drinking water was a little farther up stream.  

We both went about our things and when Dylan was done we walked back to camp together in silence.  I started breakfast which would consist of rations until the boys learned out to hunt and gather.  I hated this part of the training.  I hated the rations.  They were dry and boring, but at least they were nutritious, I wasn't going to be anxious with this change of diet.  One small miracle. 



# Aug 17, 2015 @ 8:30AM

The forest is a wonderful place to learn how to survive in.  There are wayward pines, caves, trees large enough to hide in the trunks or in the branches.  There is plenty of things to learn, but some of these boys don't fucking listen.  James and John being two of the worst know it alls and wrong too.  

Dylan told everyone who was on what team and gave us each a number.  He was one, and he has James, Brock, Nate, Carl, and Matt.  Trent was two with Phillip, Chris, Timothy, Patrick and John.  I got three Jerry, Michael, Larry, Steven and Bob.  Of course I got Bob - just fucking great.

Today the boys learn the three basics of survival, shelter, water and fire.  Today was rations for breakfast, it'll be rations for lunch and dinner until we start hunting and gathering.  We wll augment on day 4 with flora as the boys learn about the plants that we can eat, and some of their other uses. Then on day 6 will learn to trap and hunt, and from that day forward we eat what the boys can catch and make.  So I suspect in these first few days these boys will be eating great afterwards they might be on a self imposed diet.

Shelter was first.  Oh. my. God. how stupid are some of these boys.  We were teaching how to build a lean to when there was no viable natural shelters around.  James and John the two resident snobs refused to get their hands dirty.  They wouldn't touch the fallen limbs.  They wouldn't help build their teams lean to.  I was thankful I had neither one of them.  I'd probably kill them.  And it was a good thing to split them up.  Dylan had also split up Nate and Chris, Nate and Patrick as well as Matt and Timothy.  He really was good at this.  He had the teams chosen beforehand.  

Jerry, Michael, Larry, Steven and Bob actually worked really well together considering, all of them but Bob was an outsider, and it made me wonder if their placement with me had been coincidental.  Bob was  drama queen.  But at least he helped.  He still fussed over everything, how he was too good to pick up the pine bough, but he was saying it while he was picking up the pine bough, unlike James and John who refused to help.

I suspect once the rest of the boys find out they will be working teams and their grades depend on teamwork they'll all get on two boys to pull their weight.

Next is water, we are teaching them the signs of water even though Dylan and I know and probably Trent though he's kinda an idiot if you ask me know exactly where the creek is.  



# Aug 17, 2015 @ 12:30PM

We are on lunch break and the boys were taught and all three groups found the creek that was a mile's hike from camp.  We informed them of the situation.  The pool was for swimming but not drinking.   And water was up out of the pool for drinking.  I doubted the boys would walk a mile just to bathe most boys didn't care.  Though they all took it upon themselves to throw each other into to the pool.  John was the only of the boys who didn't know how to swim and when Brock threw him in there was some major flailing and lots of laughing before Dylan dove in and got the boy.

I couldn't help the memories that flooded into my brain.  I'm not interested in Dylan.  But the unrequited love never actually goes away.  Dylan may be cute, and he may be well cut… dan he's well cut but he's not Sage.  Two days in and I'm already missing my love.  This is going to be hell.  It might be prudent to keep my eyes averted when everyone else is playing in the water.  I didn't seem to be the only one avoiding the group, Matt came down and sat with me, I'm going to be the good listener and shut this for a bit.



# Aug 17, 2015 @ 6:35PM

Matt sat with me for a good twenty minutes not saying anything.  His eyes were downcast like he was avoiding looking at his peers.  He looked like he had one too many beat downs too.  I felt for him.  But I didn't have any sage advice so I left it be.  I just sat with him.  When he was ready to talk he would.

Timothy had glared at me several times in those 20 minutes.  Jealousy never looked good on anyone.  

Fire brought us all back to camp, after the mile long trek back all the boys were ready to have a warm fire to sit by and were well attentive.  All of them got a chance to start a fire and we had warm rations for dinner.  Most of the boys went looking around the camp under the instructions - do not eat anything and stay within sight of the fire.  Which by now was raging hot.  It would stay that way until we went on our hiking trek, but the boys still had several more days of learning how to do things before they would be allowed out on their own.

For some of these boys it was their first time out in the woods, the older boys on the other hand had been out at least once.  It was a yearly trip everyone took from the age 13 to the age 17.  Their last trip, the year they turned 18 was a different trip entirely - much shorter, but there was no survival training before hand as a refresher,  you were dropped in the middle of the woods somewhere and you were told to find your way back to the Boulder HQ.  Sometimes we had to go out and retrieve lost souls, they would graduate, but they would never be hunters. Even if that's all they'd ever trained to be.  They would end up with a desk job like Gary - trained to do the work but incapable of being a field hunter.  We needed desk jockies.

Until this little excursion that's what I had been.  Dae'lin refused to give me work.  Said I needed to process things.  Said I was too shook up.  Just because I was emotionally compromised didn't make me useless.  I could hunt.  I think this was Dae'lin's way of testing me.  I knew Dorian had a hand in it.  Or maybe they both wanted me to stop hunting.  I don't know their reasons nor do I really care.  I'm out and about doing some of the things I love.  I only wish it wasn't for so long and away from Sage.  Life would be so much simpler is Sage where here with me.

Chris and Nate sat down in their bedrolls.  Neither of them had set up their tents yet.  I hadn't set up mine either.  But then I didn't bring one.  My ability is far more useful than a tent that could become shredded and I didn't have to carry it.  

"You might want to set up your tents.  It might rain tonight."

"Uncle Nox," Nate said, "You don't have one."

I smiled.  "I didn't bring one.  I have perfectly good shelter."

Dylan laughed as he walked by, "You cheat."

I shook my head.  "It's not cheating.  I am using all of my resources to the best possible outcome.  A tent adds weight which makes it harder to carry.  I'm not as strong as you full Venatori, so I do what I can.  My shelter goes with me wherever I go."

Jerry sat down and said, "Not all of us are Magnus.  It's not fair."  The other boys on the team sat down with us too.

"This isn't a test of Magnus.  It's a test of survival.  I learned how to survive in the AU building.  I get hurt if I don't use my ability.  You are stronger, faster, more agile.  This is my only advantage."  I wove four balls - one of each element - and juggled them around showing off my ability.

"You call it cheating.  I call it surviving."  I said with a smile.

Dylan shook his head as yet another straggler sat down with us around my tentless area.  Matt smiled at me and sat down just outside the rest of the group.  "You seem to be attracting more than your own team."  Dylan joked.

"Kindred souls and family what can I say."  I grinned at my one time crush.  He rolled his eyes as he stood up.  He put a hand on Matt's shoulder and squeezed before leaving.  

The rest of the boys followed suit like there was some sort of unspoken words I didn't hear when Matt had sat down.

We stayed in our respective spots for a while before he moved closer and sat down on the soft ground next to me.  At first I wasn't sure Matt had said anything it was barely a whisper, "How do you do it?" he asked.

I looked at him and frowned. "Do what?"

He waved his hands to indicated my entire body, "This.  How do you be gay, be open, and not bothered by the stares you get?"

I chuckled softly.  "This is how I hide, Matt."

"This is hiding?"  He frowned and was about to get up.  "Fine don't talk with me."

I grabbed his hand before he left and tugged him back towards the ground  He went willingly.  "I speak the truth, Matt.  I did this for so long it's who I became to the outside world.  I hide behind the makeup, the hair and the openness about my sexuality.  I'm a mess inside.  I've nightmares every night.  The same one over and over again.  I'm prone to self harm and extraordinary risk taking.  I don't want to die anymore, but that doesn't mean I don't want to feel something controllable with self inflicted pain, or put myself at risk so it's all over.  I still have bad days.  But I learned to be me, to understand when I feel like that I need to seek help.  I have a wonderful boyfriend now who I can count on.  That's a first for me.  This is just a mask I wear.  You look down at the ground, you don't meet someone's eyes - that's how you hide.  I redirect when I hide."

Matt's body had visibly relaxed during the small tale of my life.  "I know Bob, told you that Tim and I were together."

I nodded but didn't say anything.  "How do you do it?  Be friendly with your ex's?"

I laughed.  "I have no ex's like that.  I have ex-lovers.  But I don't have ex-boyfriends or ex-girlfriends"

"Then what's up with you and Dylan?"  Matt whispered.

"Nothing.  I kissed Dylan when I was 14.  He beat the shit out of me afterwards."  I grinned at him, "We've grown up since then, we are being friendly."

Matt moved closer and leaned in, "I saw the way you looked at him.  How you avoid looking at everyone else too."

I laughed and laid back on my sleeping bag.  "Matt, Dylan is hot.  He will always be hot.  His body … yeah, I don't care how monogamous one is, you don't ever stop looking Matt.  But I avoid looking at anyone in most situations and I have rules.  I may be a player, but all games have rules."

Matt laughed.  "Like what?"

"My rules?"  He nodded so I continued to answer his question.  "No teenagers for starters.  No married individuals.  If a married couple wants a third that's different.  I don't do single mothers.  I always - always - use protection no matter who I'm with.  I'm sure there are others, but that's the basics."

"What did your parents say?  Mine don't like this.  It's hard going home on the weekends.  They are always trying to set up with some girl."  Matt breathed the last out slowly.

"I didn't have parents.  Dorian is gay so when he saw it, he gave me good advice.  Margo she helped me understand what I was feeling without judging.  My father though probably didn't take it well.  He found out about me when I was 18.  He already hated me before that cause Nick and I got caught kissing, and that whole thing was a big mess.  Thankfully Dorian forbid me from seeing him again."

"Why?"

"Nick's my half brother."

Matt's mouth formed a big O and I grinned.  "But it's all good.  Nothing more happened."  I nodded in the direction of the others coming back.  "We should probably not talk about this with your other peers around."

Matt nodded and moved back to the log at the far edge of my area.  He smiled brightly at me and his amber eyes glittered in the fire light - something that they hadn't done since I'd met him.  Maybe he'd actually have a good time.

I am going to call Sage, I need to hear his voice, even if only for a moment.



# Aug 18, 2015 @ 4:55AM

I missed Sage.  I love hearing his voice even when I didn't understand a word of what he was doing.  Sage was still working when I called.  I told him I just wanted to hear his voice, it didn't matter what he said.  So he put his phone in front of his keyboard propped up against the corner of his two screens with Skype on and I watched as my beautiful love typed and worked.  He makes some of the cutest faces while he's preoccupied.  

Sage is a multi-tasker and a half he held a perfectly good conversation with me while he stared at his screen, but when he started to type the conversation died and he talked about what he was doing.  When he started on his ramble I told him I was probably going to fall asleep.  He smiled at me and reassured me, that was exactly what he had intended.  I fell asleep to the voice of my boyfriend talking about hacking whatever it was he was doing.  And yet when I wake up this morning with my nightmares I'm more afraid than I have been in ages.  

I don't know if anyone besides Dorian, Margo and now Sage realy know that Garrett is the stuff of my nightmares - my demon.  I'm pretty sure they get it.  Though Sage has never met the man, and I don't ever intend him to.  I wonder how many children he's screwed up.  And it's partially my fault cause I didn't say anything.  I never really said anything until Dorian saw my back.  He told Margo and I had to explain the scars.  Years upon years of self inflicted scars.  She didn't believe I was doing it to myself at first.  She thought I was over hurting myself.  Apparently, that never goes away.  

I went to the pool in the creek to wash up.  Blood smells.  And in the wilderness that could be even more dangerous.  And today we will be trekking through the woods looking at plants.  The wonders of nature astound me.

There are plants that can heal you, plants that can kill you.  And sometimes it's the same plant that can do both.  Irony at it's finest.  But most of all we are teaching the boys what they can eat if they are in a pinch and what they can't.  But the healing part is helpful if you run into a human who needs saving.  There are very few injuries we can't heal from in a couple of hours.  Jumping off a high place is one such injury, but no amount of herbs will fix that.

Both Dylan and I did our morning thing in silence.  Though I did watch him.  It brought back memories of Madison walking in on me while I watched Dylan practice for his next swim competition in the Olympic sized pool in the AU building.  The rooms above it were just class rooms but we hardly used them since the Gym below was always so busy.  Usually kids used them to hide, but this one overlooked the pool and I was having a few alone time minutes when she walked in.  Sage, I know you are reading this so, ask me and I'll tell you the whole story.  Needless to say I'm not going to write down the details of my first time here.  

When Dylan got out he waved his hands to indicate I should stay seated.  He laid his towel on the ground, presumably so he didn't get dirty as water still clung to his body.  I didn't hid my admiration as he sat down oblivious to the look I had on my face.  But I was slow to hid it and he blushed - actually blushed because I was looking at him.  "I don't think I'll ever get used to that."

"Sorry, old habits."  I turned and looked out at the creek.  

We stayed in silence for a while before Dylan broke it, "Is Matt okay, now?"

I shook my head.  "I think he'll be okay.  Being gay is rough, and when your peers don't like it, or are afraid of it, it makes things difficult."

"He could have come to me."

I laughed.  "Dude, you are straighter than any arrow.  He's not going to come to you  But I think we need to watch him.  He's passive.  Probably submissive.  And you know how the boys get."

Dylan frowned, "You don't think he'll stand up to them?"

I shook my head.  "No I don't.  He hides from it all.  Hides from them all, always separating himself from the group."

"You never had that problem."

I laughed at Dylan's comment.  "I have a whole shit town of other problems.  And I enjoyed myself."

Dylan smiled, "You could have fooled me - about the problems not the enjoying yourself.  I'll take your word on that."    He got up - gracefully unfolding his body and shook out his towel.  "We should get back."

I was glad he thought I didn't have problems.  But my life was not al peaches and cream like everyone thought.  

There was very little silence as we walked back, Dylan asked, "You have nightmares a lot?"

"You saw?"  

Dylan nodded. "I'm surprised you didn't wake anyone up."

"I have nightmares every night."

"Can I ask about what?  What makes you so afraid you dream about it every night?  I mean you hunt monsters for a living, you can't be afraid of much."

I grinned.  "I'm afraid of a good many things, heights, flying, needles, clowns…"  I looked over at Dylan in the darkness but he wasn't looking at me.  "My nightmares are things from my childhood.  Things that coalesced into my underlying fears.  Fears I work everyday to conquer but always seem to fall just a little bit too short of - though, that's getting better, slowly."

We neared camp and Dylan stopped grabbing my arm and pulling me close.  "Do you think I'm easy to talk to?"

I leaned back taking a better look at the man who was starting to worry me a little.  "Dylan, I hardly know you.  This is probably our first detailed conversation.  Why?"

Dylan shook his head and walked off towards camp, leaving me staring after him, wondering what the fuck just happened.



# Aug 18, 2015 @ 9:58PM

While we walked the boys through the forest I kept an eye on Matt and on Dylan.  He was acting strange since our morning conversation.  He avoided me.  Which in and of itself was not unusual, if you take away the fact that since this trip started Dylan had not been avoiding me.  I was concerned.  Something was bothering him.

But the boys were schooled in the woos of berries in probably the worst way possible.  The know-it-alls who were James and John decided to disregard Trent's words.  He said with a very strict voice, "Do not eat the purple berries."  And he meant it.  But he didn't give them a reason.  Dylan snickered and I rolled my eyes.  

There are kids in every group who will do everything you say not to do.  The purple berries weren't poisonous.  But they aren't pleasant either.  They made a big show of eating the purple berries.

First the purple berries stain your teeth when you eat them.  If you can stomach swallowing after you start then you are in for a ride.  The boys didn't spit out the bitter berries they both swallowed.  I know a few guys who would like that fact.  

A few minutes later the boys declared triumph - nothing happened.  The three of us all laughed.  They would be in for it later.

And sure enough, while we all sat at camp eating our edible berries and leaves to augment our rations tonight those two boys were digging holes in the ground to cover the remains of their dinner which went right through them - repeatedly.  Ex-lax has nothing on these berries.  A few of the other boys wretched at the smell.  Trent was having a good laugh.  As were most of the other boys - all the ones not sitting around my bedroll.  I had my team sitting here - all outcasts in their own right, and Nate and Chris.  Matt sat at the edge of the little group between us and Dylan.

Timothy stopped by Matt and knelt down next to him and whispered something even I couldn't hear.  Matt never looked my way as he stood up and followed Timothy away.  Unlike Matt, Timothy spared me a grin and it wasn't a friendly one.  The one look made my hackles rise.  I waited a few seconds before I followed the pair of boys.

They were easy to follow, both of them traipsing through the forest underbrush making every possible noise.  They stopped just the side of one of the large trees and I stopped when they did hiding behind my own tree and a veil.

There were no words, but I recognized the sound and I was about to leave when I heard Matt whispering to Timothy.  "No.  I don't want to do this.  We broke up.  You dumped me."

Timothy snickered.  "He won't like you.  Come on, we can have fun still.  You know you want to."

Matt's voice was weaker this time as he whispered, "No, I don't want to do this."

I closed my eyes remembering when Trees had thrown herself at me without warning.  But this was different.  I could hear Timothy forcing himself on Matt and Matt's small protests.   I pushed every ounce of my ability to the far reaches of my mind.  Anger brought out the worst in people and I was no different.  This was a boy, he was pissing me off but he wasn't a monster - at least not yet.

I stepped from around my tree and walked quietly towards the boys. I wasn't going to be anyone's champion, but I wasn't going to let anyone be abused under my watch either. Matt's continued protests were mingled with unwanted reactions his body couldn't contain.  When I rounded the large tree they were standing behind I saw Matt's body pressed up against the three.  Timothy's hand was in his ex's pants and his lips were sucking hard against Matt's neck.

I cleared my throat and Matt's eyes went wide when he saw me.  Timothy on the other hand didn't turn around to see.  "You can have your turn, next.  But he's mine first."

I frowned.  It wasn't uncommon for a boy or two to become the sexual conduit of a bunch of boys fantasy while they were all cooped up together for 30 days.  I had enjoyed being that boy - but I was self deprecating nearly every day.  And sex was something I used to make myself feel better.  Matt was no such tool. I spoke in a low voice.  I could feel the heat in it, but I didn't raise my voice.  "He's no ones, and you will stop now.  He said no."

Timothy heard my voice and turned to look at me and glared at me.  "He's mine.  You can't stop me."  The overly eager boy rushed at me from his spot near Matt.  I didn't need my ability or need to be Venatori to beat this raging bull.  I side stepped him with ease and he tripped and fell into the sticker bush full of blackberries head long.

I spared a glance for Matt as he slid down the tree trunk and curled up in a ball and I knew he was doing everything he could not to cry.

Another set of footsteps came into hearing and then Trent came into view.  He asked, "What's going on?"

I was about to say nothing, when Timothy crawled out of the bush crying.  "He threw me in here when I tried to stop him from abusing Matt."

I didn't say anything, I must moved towards Matt who was still in a ball at the foot of the tree.  I knelt down and asked, "You alright?"

He didn't answer me, but he uncurled from his ball and leaned into me and I wrapped my arms around him.  I looked up to Trent who was now standing over me, "Does this look like someone reacting to someone who just abused them?"

Timothy being the idiot that he is, chose that moment to pull me away from Matt and reaffirm that he had been the one attacking Matt.  "Get away from him you monster."  Timothy yelled.  

Matt pulled away from Timothy the moment his ex touched him and Trent took the offending boy by the shoulder and sighed. "I doubt, Nox would hurt Matt.  He has rules Timothy.  And number one is you don't force anyone.  Seems to be a rule you need to learn."

I laughed.  He wasn't wrong.  Trent looked down at me, "I got this one, you manage him alright?"

I nodded.  I sat down against the tree that Matt had vacated when he'd pulled away from Timothy.  Trent lead the other boy away and I could only hear every other word that came from Trent's mouth.  I really didn't care what he said to him.  There was only so much punishing we could do.  We weren't parents.  And we were in the middle of nowhere.  Timothy might get latrine duty - which would be a suitable punishment considering James and John's current predicament.

Matt crawled over to me and curled up in my lap and leaned his entire body against mine.  He cried and I let him.  I wished someone had been her for me when shit hit the fan like this.  I'm not talking Jace.  Cause he did this for me on many occasions, just holding me when I cried.  I knew all too well what this felt like, I had hated feeling alone my entire life.  No one should feel that.  So I let Matt cry until he'd fallen into a quiet and still slumber.

I carried him back to his bedroll.  Which I had Nate move next to ours.  Between Nate's and mine.  No one was going to get to Matt while I was lying there.  I would deal with the morning when it came.  I had a feeling my secret was going to be out.



# Aug 19, 2015 @ 4:05AM

I woke to my nightmares.  I bolted upright and I could feel the blood dripping down my back.  I hated this feeling.  I wove the elements around me and let their healing take affect.  The skin knitting together always felt weird.  I didn't like feeling it.  But it was necessary.  

The fires all were dead except a few embers keeping the fire warm.  I looked over to the sleeping form of Matt.  He shivered in the cool air.  I warmed the air around him and he stopped mostly, he still shivered but I think that was something I couldn't do anything about while he slept.

I looked up and Dylan was standing over me with a smile. He whispered, "You need to wash up?"

"I don't want to leave him here."  I nodded towards Matt.  "Timothy might try something while I'm gone and I couldn't let that happen."

"No one ever watched over you like that."

I smiled.  "No one cared about me.  I care about him."

"You don't even know him."

I shrugged.  "I don't have to know him to understand what he's going through."

Dylan frowned.  "I wanted to talk to you, but not here."

"I'll wake him up, if you don't mind an extra set of ears."  I said knowing that Dylan would likely decline.  But I was wrong he nodded.  I shook Matt careful not to touch him too much.  

His eyes shot open and I could see the fear in them.  I smiled at him.  "I need to wash up, but I don't want to leave you here.  You want to come with us do the creek?"  I motioned to Dylan standing a few feet away.  Matt nodded and uncurled from his sleeping bag.

The three of us walked out of the camp and headed for the creek.  We were silent for many steps, only the rare crunching of leaves underfoot.

Dylan broke the silence.  "The scars.   Can you talk about them?"

I sighed.  "What do you want to know?"

"When did they start?"  Dylan asked almost too quiet to hear even for my ears.

"When I was six when they started appearing."

"Do you know why?"

I nodded.  "I do it to myself.  I dream of a demon beating me with tentacles of made up of the elements.  When I wake up sometimes I have marks, sometimes they are just red, sometimes they are like they are tonight."

Dylan stopped and stared at me.  "Can I see?"

"I'll show you if you tell me why you are asking." 

Dylan nodded.  "Okay."

I turned around and lifted my t-shirt.  I heard them both gasp when they saw the gashes and blood.  No one tried to touch me, that was a good thing, or I might have freaked out a little more than I already was.  Heart racing, breathing fast.  I was glad no one touched me.  I pulled the shirt back down and started walking back towards the creek.  

They both followed.  When we got to the edge of the water I pulled my shirt off and started soaking it in the water.  Dylan knelt down next to me.  "You know I have a son?"

I turned to look at Dylan and shook my head.  "No, I didn't."

I continued to wash my shirt against the stones.  "He's a firestarter."

I froze and gasped.  "He's done with training?"

Dylan nodded as he sat down on the bank.  "Yes.  He's six, too."

"He only touch fire?"  I asked.  "Who was his teacher?"

Dylan frowned.  "He can only touch fire.  Garrett Spencer was his teacher."

My eyes closed and I fought back the rage that enveloped me. I could feel Dylan's eyes on me, but a hand on the other side touched my shoulder.  Matt whispered, "He's angry.  There is fire everywhere."

Dylan glanced around.  Matt shook his head.  "He's in control"    

Dylan asked, "What's wrong Nox?"

Matt's hand on my shoulder grounded the fire and the other raging elements and I turned to look at the teenage and smiled.  "You are are ground to a Magnus?"

Matt shrugged.  "I am Magnus, but I can't touch any of it.  I repel it."

I laughed softly.  "That's not repelling, that's absorbing.  Thank you.  You are handy to have around.  I know a lot of people that would abuse that power." 

Matt sighed and looked down.  I frowned, "We'll deal with that later."  I turned back to Dylan and pulled Matt down closer he sat down and leaned against me.  "Garrett was my teacher.  He found my spark came when I was afraid.  So he made me afraid by hitting me.  But not so the world could see.  He's press my back against the wall and he'd whisper that I was his in my ear.  He'd then turn me to face the wall.  My hands spread shoulder width apart.  He'd kick my feet to be hip width apart and then he'd tell me to close my eyes.  Then he'd get in my head and he'd hit me.  He'd make me spark, and he'd hit me again.  He'd hit me if I made noise.  But never where anyone could see.  The last time I was with Garrett, was right before I would graduate to regular Magnus classes.  But Garrett when to try to hit me again.  I sparked."

Dylan interrupted, "We all know about the accident."

"That's the thing, It wasn't an accident.  I did it on purpose.  I lite him on fire. I put it out when I realized I did it."  I sighed.  Matt gasped beside me.  His hand was laid across my leg.  I think he wanted to curl up closer, but he wasn't comfortable. And until we set boundaries I wasn't going to let him close.  I wasn't going to sleep with him.  I wasn't going to be anything more than a friend.  I knew he needed to feel safe and I'd give him that.

I looked at Dylan.  "When my nightmare ends, I'm looking at the face of my demon."

"Who is it?"  Dylan asked.

"Garrett. Why are you asking, Dylan?"

"My son.  The scars showed up a few weeks ago.  Lana, has no idea what's going on.  He's waking up bloodied, and has scars just like that."

"I'm sorry."  I said.  "I don't know how to fix it.  Or how to block it.  I've been having nightmares every night since I was six.  Take him to Dr. Margo Silverman.  She has an opening at 9:30.  I can arrange it."

"The dragon?"

I nodded.  "She knows about me.  She can help your son."

"Sam doesn't need therapy, he's not troubled."  Dylan said.

"He is.  He's just not telling you.  Take him."

I pulled out my phone and I called Sage on Skype.  He picked up on the first ring.  "You are calling early."

He grinned at me.  "Why are you shirtless, love?"

I laughed and smiled.  I pulled my shirt up out of the water.  "Washing the blood out."

Sage frowned.  "I'm sorry."

"No worries." I reassured him.  "I need you to tell Margo that Dylan's son, Sam needs to take my spot in therapy and have her set a new appointment for when I get back.  But only one.  It may not be regular."

"What changed Nox?"  Sage asked concerned.

"Nothing, but if Garrett has hurt other boys like he did me, then I need to make sure I tell Margo."

Sage nodded.  "I'll do it as soon as her office opens. Why's the eye candy?"

I grinned.  I pointed the phone at Dylan and introduce them, then at Matt.  

Sage smiled.  "Matt, Nox is a good man.  He'll keep you safe.  We'll keep you safe, if you let us."

Matt smiled at Sage, one of those real smiles that I'd only seen once this trip.

Sage and I chatted for a little while and then we hung up   Dylan swam and Matt leaned against a tree trunk and slept.  I imagine that's what he was trying to do it couldn't be too comfortable.

Taking this trip I hadn't intended to make any friends.  And yet here I was playing big brother to one of the boys - a role I've never had in my life, and Dylan is confiding in me because of my childhood.  Two very strange things to happen and it's only day 4, well the beginning of day 5 but barely.  Today is first aid.  CPR, treating broken bones, as well as other typical hunter injuries.  It'll also include knowledge of fatal injuries even if they don't look it.



# Aug 19, 2015 @ 8:54AM

It was another busy day.  Full of teaching the boys how best to handle injury in the wilderness.  Since all venatori are taught to hunt down other supernatural creatures.  We had to teach all about how you could get injured, and how you could fix it, or what to do in the event you might die from a wound - and what wounds you could die from.

Even Venatori have heart failure, and issues breathing when injured.  Our fast healing is all well and good, but these two injuries can slow it down dramatically.  So it's always best to have a conscious and breathing victim.  

CPR caused drama through all the boys.  There were ‘dolls' to practice on, but they all happened to be male - which made all but a few boys refuse to practice.  Chris was okay doing it - he'd grown up on a farm, he had done far worse things - like sticking his hand up a cow's - no idea what to call it - to inseminate it.  

The boys, especially John and James laughed as Chris and the others who were willing to participate.  Their words weren't kind and I'm not going to repeat them.  Funny thing is, Nate turned around while they were harassing Matt and yelled at them.  "At least he's trying.  He's not going to fail like you are."

Failing survival was always thought of as a kid who was a total loser.  Why?  Because it's always viewed as a goof off class - until you take it.  Only those who are going to be hunters are required to take it every year.  I know I said it was required before, but I was trained to be a hunter.  But someone like Dorian who was never going to be a hunter only took survival once.  And they don't get dropped off in the middle of the woods before they turn 18 so they can complete the biggest test of their lives - surviving alone.

They take a group of kids up into the middle of the Rocky Mountains with nothing but what they can carry by helicopter and drop them off in pairs with the only objective of finding your way back to HQ in Boulder.

I'll tell that story one day.

Dylan and Trent let those in their groups go when they wouldn't practice.  They didn't care if they learned or not, but I did.  Thankfully I only had my drama queen, Bob, who wouldn't participate.  And he sat there for about two hours - starving and drenched from the rain cause guess what it started to pour.  About 20 minutes into the storm it started to hail.  He did his thing quickly - and perfectly I might add, before running to cover under the nearest wayward pine.  The boy had at least listened.  I was proud.  Sad he was stubborn, but he did the job.

Bob, had taken to sitting with others not with the rest of his group.  I beckoned him over and he grudgingly came.  If you stay over here I'll make sure you stay warm tonight, that rain gave you a chill you've yet to shake.

He frowned, "I'm not human, I can't get sick."

I nodded.  "I know.  But hypothermia can still kill a Venatori."

I wrapped warm air around him and his eyes widened in realization.  He didn't take long before he had his things in that warm spot and was wrapping up in his sleeping bag.  I heard him mumble, "Thanks,' before he drifted off into slumber.

The boys were starting to notice that the rations were dwindling.  Tomorrow there would only be enough for breakfast.  A great many of the boys were in denial that we would let them starve.  They were right about that, but you can go seven days without food before you were really dying, and for a Venatori that time was even longer.  After breakfast, they would begin learning how to trap and fish.  From this point out, they would have to eat what they caught.  In a few days we'd teach them how to hunt, but there were a few steps we needed before we taught them that.  Like how not to get lost in the woods.

Sage called and let me know Margo had done as I asked.  My love was smiling brightly at me and I even got a chance to speak to Drake, who happened to get up right as we were about to say good-bye.  It was good seeing my orange-eyed little dragon.  I missed him as much as I missed Sage.

Tomorrow is another day.  Matt and I also had a heart to heart.  I was grateful to know the boy had no desires angled my direction.  He confided his fancies but they aren't mine to reveal.  But we also had a talk about who had abused his power.  He didn't have any better childhood than I did.  His mentor was an erratic firestarter.  His mother was erratic.  Many of the Erudite Magnus were - those would were not naturally gifted but could be taught to bend an element.

Matt could see all four elements.  He saw patterns like I did, and he had his own trick for turning it off.  But the curious thing was that every single one of those who abused Matt's power did so with ‘love'.  It was a touch, a comforting hand.  They always extended it to Matt.  He said it was the first time he'd ever comforted someone else when he touched me.  He didn't know any other way - other than to touch me.  Thankfully, I don't lose control often, and I don't mind the touchy feely aspects of pack life.  Even Sage likes to have Drake in bed, touching him.  Our own little pack forming.  I didn't let Matt in on that preview of my life, I need to talk with Sage first, but Matt needs a friend, he needs the loving environment he's not getting from his own family.  I don't have a problem giving him what he needs.  

I should sleep - or at least try to.  Tomorrow will be a long day.

An unusual night, still had nightmares - the same one.  The same violence.  The same feelings.  I woke with a start, as I always do.  You'd think I'd be used to these dreams after all these years, but the dream wasn't just me.  It was a boy and a girl the same age.  There was a teenager who stared back at me while the tendrils fell down on his skin. Six kids, including myself, I was the oldest, but the teenage boy was the closest to my age.  

There was no blood this morning.  When Dylan came to see if I wanted to go I shook my head. "Do you have paper? A pencil?  Anything to draw with?"

Dylan scratched his head then nodded.  He looked concerned and tossed me a notebook he'd kept with the test papers for the boys final written exam.  That was the sucky bit about the whole thing.  "You gonna write a Dear John note to us?"

He was teasing, but I frowned up at him.  "No.  My dream was different I need to record it while it's fresh."

I didn't recognize any of the kids in my dream.  One looked familiar, but I couldn't place him.  I started with him.  My drawings weren't great, but after years of sketching my dreams I'd picked up a few things.  By the time I'd sketched the boy, Dylan had returned.  He sat down on my bag and and watched as I set the paper down and started on the next kid - the little girl.

It took me an hour and a half to sketch out the basics of each child.  Dylan is frowning over the first drawing still but he's not said anything.  I had to know, "Tell me you don't know him."

"Every detail is right."  Dylan whispered.

I frowned.  "Fuck!" I whispered…

Dylan and I stared at each other and he hurriedly grabbed the other five pages.  "You saw each one of them?"  I nodded.  Dylan kept going.  "I know this one.  Her lessons were right after Sam's.  Her name is Emma.  I've never met her family."

"She worked with Garrett too?"

Dylan nodded, "Nox, how did you know these things?"

I shook my head.  "I have no fucking idea.  If those two worked with Garrett, the other three are real.  I need to tell Dorian."  I got up and grabbed my phone and started off to find signal.

Dylan grabbed my arm.  "Wait.  There is nothing we can do now.  None of them look younger than Sam and Emma.  I think they are all out of immediate danger."

"Do I look like I'm out of immediate danger?"  I sighed.  I tried to hold back my anger and not vent it at Dylan.  It wasn't his fault.  

"I mean, Garrett can't physically hurt them."  Dylan sighed,  "There is no proof he's still doing anything.  While you were with him, there were never any marks?  Right?"

I nodded. "He still did it to them. I have to find them.  Tell them they aren't alone."

Dylan held tighter to my wrist and I wanted to yank it from his hands, but he was strong than I was.  I knew this, yet I did it anyway.  Dylan didn't budge and I bruised my wrist in the process.  Dylan released his hold on me looking apologetic but he didn't apologize.    "You can't do anything about it right now.  I'd love to go running and tell someone about Sam, but they aren't going to listen while I'm way out here."

"We can't do anything, but Dorian can."  I said it louder than I meant to and the venom in my voice was clear.  Dylan just didn't understand.

"You would abuse your friendship with one of the leaders of the Academy just to find three kids who may not even be real?  You'd put Dorian in that position?"

I stared at him for too long.  He asked again, "Would you?"

I nodded my head slowly.  "Yes.  To save a bunch of kids the shit I went through, I would ask Dorian to jump out of an airplane without a parachute, if it would save these kids."

"He's your friend.  You'd be asking him to risk everything!"

"I'm not asking Dorian to do anything I wouldn't do.  I would jump out of the plane before Dorian.  I would save him and the children if that would help.    I would face my biggest fucking fear to save these kids."  I could feel the hot tears building at the corners of my eyes.  "I don't care if they aren't real.  Knowing that two of them are, I have to try to find them."

I walked away from Dylan with my phone out searching for a signal.  

I don't know how far away I walked, but I heard the sound of crunching leaves behind me as some ran to catch up.  It was Dylan.  He said as he panted to catch his breath, "Here use this.  Nox, you better hope you are right."

"I don't have to be right.  I want to be wrong.  But I can't risk it.  The sooner Dorian knows, the faster he can help these kids."  I had already sent Dorian an email with a picture of all of the sketches.  I'd sent them to Sage as well with a note, "Help Dorian find these kids."  Sage's reply was almost instantaneous.  "Okay.  What's going on?"

I sent a reply back.  "I dream about these kids.  Same dream, except they were there too, same treatment.  One of them is Dylan's son.  And I've never met the boy.  Dylan knows the little girl  - her name is Emma.  They are both Garrett's students."

Sage's reply came back, "I'll see what I can do love.  Don't worry about them, Dorian and I will find them."

I smiled at the response.  He was always trying to make me feel better.  

By the time I finished my exchange with Sage I had cooled down.  I shook my head and smiled at Dylan.  "I'm sorry."

He returned the smile and shook his head.  "There is no need to apologize.  I know I don't understand this.  I should, but I don't.  You will help them all?"

I nodded, "Do everything in my power."

Not that my power was extensive but I would do anything to make sure these kids - any kids didn't live like I did.  

I finally got Dorian on the phone.  He was groggy - so not a morning person but he was wide awake once I told him what was going on.  He said he'd get right on it.  And I knew Dorian was rushing out the door as fast as the man could make himself presentable.  

Trent was already up fixing the last of the rations for the boys.  Dylan and I were running late.  He chided us, but we got to work and started trapping and fishing.  Two of the more fun elements of the survival class - at least in my opinion.



# Aug 20, 2015 @ 10:10PM

I didn't have time to think about this morning.  Trent was already on us when we had come back from calling Dorian.  We started with how to make traps first. There were lots of different kinds.  But they had to make them all.  Rope was the best.  But there were holes.  One of the more engineering minded boys - *I can't think of his name and AJ doesn't have her notes handy on the phone* - He made one of those Wile E Coyote traps, ya know the one with the stick and the bait under the box and the rope tied to the stick.  He intended to sit there too.  I wanted to stay and watch him waste his time, but I had another group to help out.  

Timothy left Matt alone.  He better with Trent standing over the prick.  Matt was doing better now.  He smiled at the other boys.  I wondered if he the conversations we'd had had helped or if it was more the fact that Timothy wasn't gonna bother him anymore.  It was like a weight had been lifted from his body.  

Dylan was watching over Matt like a hawk too.  I'm glad, maybe Matt would be productive part of Dylan's team now.  I had my own boys to deal with.

Drama queen had take up with James and John and was being a total dick about getting his hands dirty.  I threatened to paint his nails black.  He gave me this look that said dare you.  And then the little shit said exactly what he was thinking.  "I dare you."

I looked at Dylan to make sure he'd heard and he grinned at me with a shrug.  So I wrapped up the little shit in  bonds of air and tied his hands around a tree so he couldn't move.  He squalled like a spit pig.  And I did exactly as I threatened.  I took one of the bottles of nail polish I brought with me and I painted Bob's nails black.  I could have been a dick and did it with my ability but I wasn't going to be that bad.  Besides this would come off.  I would have to reapply soon.  Maybe I should tonight…. nah.  I'm too preoccupied to sit still and do it right.

After the air bonds were release we moved into fishing.  And he was still complaining about touching smelly fish.  I guess the boy didn't want to eat.  I was done caring.  He could starve.  Maybe this was why Dylan and Trent let the boys complain and opt out.  If they failed they failed.  It wasn't because they weren't taught.  I didn't like this kinda teaching. 

Fishing wasn't done with bait and hook necessarily though it could be if you had the equipment  or knew how to make it.  My little engineer did.  He said his grandfather had taught him how to fly fish.  I watched with mild curiosity, but beyond that I didn't care.  Though I was fairly certain he was going to be the only one who caught a fish today.

I was right in the end  Bob had only berries to eat for lunch and dinner.  No one wanted to share with him.  Which made it all that much better.  Bob picked at the nail polish and the boys would giggle at him when they caught him.

We all check out traps and only one of the boys had caught a rabbit.  Teaching them how to skin a rabbit and gut it and cook had been fun.  There were several boys who had emptied their stomachs at the sight of it.  Hopefully they weren't trying to be hunters.  Things got a lot worse.

Matt and Dylan watched me as I watched them.  I'd give them a reassuring smile, but Nate was far more intuitive than the other boys.  He never asked me what was wrong.  When he wasn't with his group he was doing the family thing.  Him and Chris weren't really friends from what I gathered but yet both boys felt like family to me.  And they both treated me the same.  

That's one of the best things about Jace's family - they loved me.  Not because they had to, but because they wanted to.  Granted they loved everyone, but they took the time out of their day to send me a birthday card or send me a present for Christmas.  Jace's family loved me and I needed more than that.  They weren't mine.  I always feel bad when I say I don't have a family because I do.  I did then too.  But they were never mine.  I was always an attachment.  They loved me.  But I wasn't their son no matter how they treated me.

By the time I had time to sit and look at my phone I had two messages one from Dylan and one from Sage.  They both said the same thing.  "Don't worry about this.  We got it."  The only difference was in Sage's he said he loved me.  I sent a quick reply to Dorian to let him know I got it and I replied back to Sage.  I love you too.  And that was the truth.  In all of this, in every thing I've learned in my short life is that I fell in love with a boy who I would never have thought possible.  He's different in every possible way.  And I love that about him.

I love that he's a geek.    I love that he's smart.  Don't get me wrong it's not all perfect - he's not perfect.  He's always late.  OMG always.  He snores. He's a horrible cook though he does try.  He's too honest.  He doesn't sugar coat things.  He's blunt, and that's good and bad.  I love that he's brutally honest, but sometimes he can leave it be until it's safer.  He says what's on his mind when it's on his mind.  But there is nothing that I would change about him.  I wouldn't want to anyway it's all what makes him Sage.

But now that I've taken the time to sit down and relax my mind can't help but worry for those kids.  I know Sage and Dorian got this covered.  I know they will find them.  They will help them.  They both know how much this means to me - what it could mean to these kids.  I know if I close my eyes I'm going to see them, I don't want to go to sleep.  Nate is curled up in his bag, as is everyone else but I'm not the only one up.  Matt is watching me from his sleeping bag near mine.  It's kinda funny how none of the boys around me actually are using tents.    Everyone else is, but the eight boys by me aren't.

Matt asked, "You going to sleep?"

I shook my head.  "I don't think I can.  Only way I'm getting through tonight is in Sage's arms and he's not here."

Matt frowned.  "Tomorrow you are teaching navigation, you need sleep."

I sighed. "I know."

Matt laid his hand on my leg and smiled.  "We are here with you.  And Dorian and Sage will watch out for those other kids.  You trust them right?"

I noded.  "With my life."

He smiled.  "Good. Then lie down, go to sleep and know they are safe."

I took a deep breath and nodded.  I would try to sleep.  I knew I'd be up later, but I had to try, Matt was right.  I needed sleep.



# Aug 21, 2015 @ 9:50AM

I started awake with a hand touching my face.  I blinked my eyes to see who was standing above me.  The touch was tender, the hand was rough against my skin.  Brown eyes stared back at me.  I couldn't in the darkness.  Everything was blurred with sleep.  The form bent closer and I caught the stagnant smell of cigarette smoke, covered with the smell of dirt.  I knew it was patchouli oil but that is what it smells like and it always will.  I almost wretched with the closeness of it.  My stomach knotted and my heart beat fast as I tried to scramble backwards out of my sleeping bag.  But I was bound with air.  The face grew closer and the smile was stained yellow instead of the white it should be.  I knew it should be white but why wasn't it.  

The eyes darkened into russet brown.  I could see them clearly.  I didn't recognize the face.  It was a mash of things from my dreams.  My fears manifested in reality.  I tried to move again, but I couldn't.  There were no bounds holding me down, I couldn't move.  Fear lanced through my veins like ice.  I was shivering but I felt like I was burning up.  The voice was ragged.  "You are getting to close."

It rushed me and I fell backwards and the next thing was darkness.

When I woke up there was a group of people standing around me.  I started and pulled away from them all the memory of what had happened before still on the cusp of my memory.  I looked around but didn't see what or who it was.  Had it been a dream?

Nate followed me across the expanse of dirt I had shimmied across in my haste to be away from people.  He was smiling at me and saying something.  I had to focus on his mouth to calm down enough to understand him.  He'd said repeatedly, "You hit your head, let us finish.  It's not healing right."

That was when the pain rushed into my senses.  My body ached all over.  My head hurt, my arms felt like lead hanging from a rag doll.  I reached up and felt the blood at the back of my head.  I tried to speak but my mouth was dry.  Matt handed me a bottle of water and I smiled at him in thanks.  The drink helped and I was able to ask, "How long have I been out?"

Dylan was standing a few yards away, "You weren't up when I got up this morning.  I figured you needed the sleep.  I didn't think anything was wrong until you didn't wake up with the rest of them."

Matt spoke softly, "I noticed the blood on the rock there.  You weren't in your bag anymore, but you had fallen asleep inside.  I know you did."

Trent asked from his perch on the log behind Dylan.  "What happened, man?  You work like a like every other day."

I shook my head trying to remember, and I told them what I could.  Told them about waking early.  About the creature/thing/dream, whatever it was.  And what it said.  Everyone but Dylan was clueless, Matt might get some idea from the conversations the other day, but no one else knew what my nightmares were.  

Trent sighed, "And I thought Bob, was a drama queen."  His grin was wide and toothy and he was trying really hard to make it come off as a joke.  

I grinned back at him.  "No one's better at being a drama queen than me."

That made Trent and Dylan both laugh and Trent took that moment to regale the boys of the time I kissed Dylan.  Dylan left before I even got to kiss him. But he had been turning a nice shade of pink before he did.  When Trent was done with his tale, I rolled my eyes at him.  And Dylan called them over.  Today was a busy day.  We teach the boys all about compasses, direction, navigation by the night sky and the afternoon sun.  It was going to be an info dump of the day but today was a crucial day.  Today the boys would be set out on their own to walk an hour out then walk back to camp all by themselves.



# Aug 21, 2015 @ 2:35PM

Well navigation is going well.  The boys all took to the compass like fish out of water.  Even James and John listened.  Getting lost in the woods didn't appeal to them.  But failing shouldn't appeal either.  But hey not everyone was into that sort of thing.

Each of the boys headed off in a different direction and were told to walk an hour out.  Straight if they could.  So they followed their compass, except trees and rivers and creeks and rocks were going to get in the way.  One hour out, they were each given a watch too.  No one wanted it, but they would when their cell phones died or they didn't have tech with them.  

Trent, Dylan and I were sitting at camp preparing for our night time lessons.  Navigation by the stars was going to prove to be fun.  It was going to be a long night.  And the boys were going to be exhausted after two straight hours of walking.   

You would think that one or two of the boys would stop and just sit for an hour or so then walk back.  And you'd be right, but also in each compass and each watch was a GPS tracker.  This was activated only in case of emergency, but right now they were active and we watched several of the dots just  sat there, they were noted and they would be marked down for the lesson.  It sucked but some boys just didn't care.  They would regret it later but that was their problem not mine.

I'm still trying to process what happened this morning.  The fact that my head bled for so long made me wonder if it was not just a nightmare.  But what was it?  Was it a person?  Some creature?  I couldn't begin to think what might have been there.  And how long this 'thing' has been with me.  

The boys are starting to trickle back in.  Some of them looked a little ragged and frazzled.  Matt sat down next to me.  "You all right?"

I shrugged.  "I don't know. There is a lot I don't remember about this morning."

"You're all over the place."  Matt said with concern.

"I know.  I'm not used to people seeing that.  I'm in control, though, I promise."

Matt nodded. "I see that too.  I've seen enough out of control anger issues, or when someone's scared and freaking out.  I see the control you exert over the patterns."

"That's what Garrett taught me."

Matt looked around and moved a little closer.  "You think he had something to do with this morning?"

I shrugged.  "I don't know.  He's a dream walker.  But unless he's doing it while I'm awake now, this was different."

"You worried about it?"

I shrugged.  "I dunno. I guess going back to therapy is a must now."

"You gonna go back to Dr. Silverman?"

I closed my eyes and frowned.  "Yes.  She knows me best and it would be more of a problem to explain myself to someone new."

Trent called from where he was sitting by the fire.  "I think Rocker boy got lost."  Carl Chong was the last to arrive.  We gave him another 30 minutes, and now I gotta go look for a lost boy.  Just great.  A quick lesson to the boys on tracking which we will push tomorrow.



# Aug 21, 2015 @ 11:58PM

OMG Dumb ass kid.  Lost his compass and his watch, which means he lost his tracker.  We spent the better half of the afternoon looking for him.  We found his compass near a creek.  And the watch under a wayward pine.  

Trent went back with the boys, they weren't going to help much with the next phase of tracking.  A few of the older boys who were training to be hunters had offered to help us.  But Dylan and I declined.  "Stay with the others, "Dylan had said. "We got this."

It was our job to keep track of the boys.  Technology made it easier.  When I was a kid - Now I sound fucking old - when I was a kid we didn't have GPS in everything.  Back in Dorian's day - geez.  Technology makes us all feel old when it wasn't that long ago.  

Dylan and I followed the boy's tracks.  Unlike most people who know to stay put when they get lost our lovable little rocker boy kept moving.  He kept going in circles.  He wasn't tracking himself, but he didn't know how to navigate well enough to go in a straight line. Which was good for us.  I stayed put calling out Carl's name, and Dylan went backwards through the direction.  

The boy heard me calling and eventually headed my direction.  We waited for Dylan to make his circuit and we all went back to camp.  Stupid boy.

Carl got a lecture about staying put when you are lost.  He tried to say he wasn't lost but when we showed him the watch and the compass he shut his mouth and listened to what we had to say.  The rest of the boys got the same lecture once we returned.  Dylan was far from happy. And we had missed dinner and there was only the dredges left.  And they were burnt too.  So much for dinner.

Dylan grumpily lectured on night navigation.  Thankfully we had a clear night and the stars were out.  They would go over the star charts in detail later in the year of class.  This was just an introduction.  Not many actually needed to know the stars.  Hell I barely remembered.  But I did remember how to use it to navigate in the direction I wanted.  But I rarely worked in the hours of the night.  It was dangerous to hunt creatures in the dark.  They could more easily kill you than you them.

After the lessons were done the boys wound down around the fire.  Everyone was eager to hear Carl's tale of misadventure.  He apparently saw a mountain lion and freaked out.  He didn't mention the freaking out part, but the three of us knew he'd lost both his compass and his watch in his plight to get away from the skulking creature.  

Mountain lions were rare in these parts but not unheard of.  Maybe we'd see it later.  To set the story off there was a wolf howled in the nearby distance and most of the boys jumped.  I smiled as I sent my senses wide and closed my eyes as I laid down on my pack.  The woods were speaking to us tonight.  Maybe it would be a good night.



# Aug 22, 2015 @ 4:35AM

I hate my life sometimes.  I probably got three hours of sleep thanks to the dumb ass kid who decided to get lost.  But does my mind and body let me sleep - not a chance.  I don't need to be up now.  Hell, I tried to go back to sleep.  Even Dylan rolled back over when his alarm went off.  I hadn't noticed before now that he set one to go swimming every morning.  Midnight and 4am use to be something I could do.  I must be getting old.  

I want very much to curl back up and go to bed.  But my brain won't let me.  I got an email from Sage early yesterday evening that I didn't get until just now.  I must not have seen it last night when I was writing my end of day report.  Turns out they found four of the five kids.  The oldest teenage boy - they don't know where he is.  They have no records of him, they can't find him.  Sam and Emma have both been scheduled to see Dr. Silverman per Dorian's request.  The other two kids from my dream, Luis and Mary Ellen have been seeing their own therapists for other reasons.  Luis is depressive.  Mental health issues in the Venatori is rare. It's usually caused by external stimulus rather than nature - being born that way.  I'm fairly certain Luis stem from the same reasons mine do - Garrett.  Only no one believed him.  

Dorian insisted that Luis at least talk with Dr. Silverman once. Mary Ellen is in the psych ward in the Infirmary.  She hurt herself one too many times and is on a permanent suicide watch.  No one knows why she does, she doesn't speak to anyone.  Margo was going to look in on her, tell her that it was alright to speak about it.  She could help.

But that fifth boy was still missing - still unable to find him.  Sage went outside the Venatori records.  He started searching through the human databases.  He had emailed to tell me about that.  It was slow since he didn't want to get caught, he was trying to talk his father into helping him.  We'd see where that went.

I have to get my head on right.  I'm tired and in serious need of coffee and I don't care if I wake the whole damned camp with it.  If I'm going to teach tracking today I need to be up and about and thinking straight.



# Aug 22, 2015 @ 12:55PM

Tracking is going well.  But there isn't a lot of activity on the ground which is odd.  Maybe the prey is wary of us?  That mountain lion might be causing more of a ruckus.  We could be part of the problem too.  Most of the boys are loud when they walk.  They haven't learned the subtle art of stalking their prey yet.  They will if they intend to actually kill something tomorrow. 

Everyone is getting sick of being hungry.  The fishing is going best, but there are still only one or two of the boys who actually can catch anything.  Fly fishing boy, and my little engineer are about the only ones who regularly get something.  However Chris has found a plethora of edible berries and plants - the farmer in him I guess.  He likely will do will with the hunting too.  Being as I know Jason's brother - Chris' father is an excellent hunter.  As in he kills game for food, not hunts supernatural creatures.

One of the boys actually got a picture of the mountain lion we saw.  The eyes are too knowing.  He followed us around like he was waiting for us to do something stupid.  Trent tried to scare it away with a warning shot.  It worked for a little while, but it didn't stay away.  It stayed out of view, but the one thing survival never taught me in school was that we have the ability to track by scent.  I knew the mountain lion was around though I never saw it. I felt it through the elements and smelled the distinct scent of ‘wet cat' mixed with the deep forest smell that shouldn't be in this area of the woods, we had plenty of air and sunlight.  But I didn't mention anything because I wasn't in charge of the curriculum and I didn't want to get yelled at.  

My day has been too busy to worry about anything other than the boys.  Even keeping track of just 5 of them has been tiring.  Watching Drake isn't this hard and he's just a ball full of energy.

The mountain lion finally got bored around 8 pm and left us for the night.  I wasn't going to sleep well.  I didn't like the fact that it had stuck around all day watching us.  It wasn't natural specially after Trent had shot at it.

But that is life.  I told Dylan of my concerns.  He thought I was crazy.  But I napped a little while everyone else ate dinner.  Napping was better than full out sleeping at night.  I didn't dream when it was a nap.  It was strange really.

But I wasn't the only one that napped.  Beside me curled up on his own bag was Matt.  He smiled at me and when everyone else went to bed he sat down next to me on the log by the fire.  "You are a  hunter right?"

I nodded.  "If you think there is something to watch, then someone should believe you."

I smiled at the boy.  "I'm used to people not believing me.  Go to sleep Matt, I got this."

He shook his head.  "I don't sleep well anyway."

I sighed.  "Sorry."

He moved closer and put his head on my shoulder.  "It's not your fault.  I'm really not trying to hit on you like all the others think."

I chuckled.  "I know." I put my arm around Matt and slide down the log so I could use it to prop against it and pulled him into my arms.  He leaned against me and sighed.  "You are comforted by touch.  I wish someone would have done this for me.  Someone not Jason."

"He cared for you, didn't he?"

I nodded.  "He was everything to me as a kid.  My brother, my friend, my family.  But Jace is just a kid, he can't provide the warmth and safety an adult can."

Matt sighed again.  It wasn't one of relaxing like it had been before, this was more in frustration.  "I have all that, why does it come so easy to confide in you?  To take comfort in the relative stranger you are."

I laughed and pressed my lips to the back of his head.  "Because I'm offering it to you, and no one else is."  I whispered to him, "Matt, I'll take care of you.  I'm will never be your father, but I'll be there - no matter what."

I felt Matt smile against my chest.  He mumbled, "I think I might sleep now."

I hugged him closer and hummed my ascent as I stared into the fire.  "I wasn't going to sleep, but there was no reason Matt could.

Morning came, Nightmares all that jazz.  Yeah, I'm sure you're sick of hearing all about them.  They changed little from last night except to inflict the most damage possible to the kids in my head.  I woke with a start and my neck hurt, my back ached but despite the fire having gone out after I'd fallen asleep I was warm.  Matt still was pressed against my body.  Dylan sat down on the other side of me on the log.  "You look like shit."

I grinned up at him.  "I feel like shit."  I nudged Matt, "Wake up."  

Matt groaned and stretched and gave Dylan a shit eating grin.  Dylan shook his head.  "You have a perfectly good bedroll Matt.  I'm sure it would have been more comfortable than mister muscle head here."

I stuck my tongue out at him and sat up now that the extra weight was off my chest.  I was surprisingly well rested if achy considering my sleeping position.  "I'm gonna stretch and yoga here.  You can go ahead." 

Dylan pouted as he got up.  "I was getting used to that damned light of yours."

I produced the glowing orb of light on a faint thread of air and fire so Dylan could see it. "I can hold it out of sight."

Matt laughed.  "Seems people only want to use him."

I grinned at the boy, but he wasn't wrong in his assessment.  Dylan left me and Matt sitting by the cold fire which I started quickly with a thought.  

Matt asked, "Did it happen again?"

I shook my head. "No, the nightmare ramped up but there was no after effect like last night."

Matt watched me as I went through the yoga motions.  "I hope you don't mind me saying, but damn your boyfriend is lucky."

I raised an eyebrow at him in question and I could see the blush creeping up his face.  "What I mean is you do this, you are flexible, graceful, every inch of you says look at me.  He caught you."

I grinned at him.  "I'm the lucky one.  Sage grounds me.  This is all an act."

Matt shook his head.  "You can't tell me the yoga, the running, the things you do to keep in shape is an act."

I relented that fact.  "That's survival.  If I ate the way you guys ate, if I didn't go to the gym, I'd have been bottom of my class instead of top."

"Phil says that you could have been top of your class but you deliberately got bad grades on your finals so you'd be third in the class instead." 

I laughed a little too loudly, one of the boys closest to us rolled over and covered his head with his pillow.  "It's funny how that is still going around.  Yeah, I did.  I only got straight A's because other wise Dae'lin wouldn't let me train with the elements.  She said if my other grades suffered I wouldn't get to do what I wanted to do - which was to learn how to control the elements.  I got one B in some class, I spent the next grading period sitting at a desk reading papers and hunter reports.  I never got a B again.  Dorian told me I was going to be valedictorian of our class and I freaked out.  I went through the math, and figured out how what I needed to get on my final to bring my overall score down just enough to not be first or second.  I didn't need much overall.  For each test I calculated what I had to get and I only answered that many questions."

"A few days later Dorian came to me shaking his head.  He said, ‘You didn't answer the last question on 5 tests, so you didn't have to give a speech.' I smiled at him and said yep.  Dae'lin couldn't get mad at me cause I technically still had all A's.  But after years of taking tests in the Academy and all our standard ways of doing things, I learned the pattern, I knew what I could do to get by and instead of choosing an answer I knew was wrong I just didn't answer it."

Matt chuckled, "That seems like more work than giving a speech."

I laughed.  "For you maybe.  But for me, I hadn't even given it much thought, it was all patterns.  Once I decided what I wanted to do I just saw the answer through those patterns."

"That must be nice."

I shrugged. "I don't understand half of what I know.  Math goes over my head, but I see the patterns.  Same with physics.  The only one that I understand well is chemistry and that's because it's all related to how I see the world around me."

"I know we said I see things like you but I can't do half that."

I smiled, "You could if someone showed you how to."

"Who showed you?" He asked.

"No one.  I taught myself.  Jace and I worked on theories.  Some of them he teaches."

Matt smiled.  "Mr. Hill is an awesome teacher.  I wish I could take some more of his classes, but I can't touch the elements so I can't even qualify."

"When we get back, we'll talk with Dorian and Jace.  You let me know which class exactly you want to take and I'll pull some strings.  There are a few classes I think you'd get something out of."

Matt smiled and nodded, "All right.  Thanks.  I appreciate it."

"We have to stick together."

Matt laughed, "You should teach classes."

"I suck at teaching."  I said.

"If you say so, Nox.  I've learned more from just watching you doing things around camp than I have in the three years I've been learning about what it means to be Magnus."

Matt patted my shoulder when he left to go heed the call of nature leaving me to my yoga and my thoughts.  And it seemed I had a lot more to think about now.

Dinner smells absolutely divine.  Real food!  Granted I'm not big on game meats, but real food, not bits of fish and rabbit with berries.  Today the boys learned all about hunting.  The ability to shoot a gun was already known as was the crossbow.  But this was the prospect of tracking.

They scared away several critters, but Trent the lucky bastard got a shot off at a buck in a timely manner.  And it was a clean shot.  We had food for a few days now.  Though the way these boys ate I don't know.  

We did have a few mishaps out in the woods though.  Bob, shot John in the arm with his arrow.  Oh. my. God. at the yowling the boy did.  And then he proceeded to pummel Bob.  Which I stopped, but not until John got a few good licks in.  Bob shot John after all, it was fair game.  But I didn't want the boy damaged anymore than he was and John didn't need to get a taste for being the bully anymore than he already was.

Chris refused to shoot the deer, which is why Trent took the shot.  Food was food and we were all starting to feel the strain of fending for ourselves.  Though there were emergency rations if necessary, or we could send someone to Boulder HQ which was a day's hike away.  But the boys were learning, and no one was starving yet despite the fact they thought they were.

You could see the strength growing in each of the boys - particularly in those who weren't physically active on a normal basis.  The walking alone, and the diet on top of it was putting their metabolism to work.  Matt was noticing.  But I was fairly certain none of the other boys were noticing Matt noticing them.  We'd both learned how to keep our eyes to ourselves when appropriate.  Though I was far more obvious when out of the locker room than Matt was.  He was shy.  I don't know why the boy was growing on me, he did remind me of myself.  But I think there was more to it than that.

I got side tracked, back to Chris and his refusal.  Apparently you don't kill wild animals.  Which I know is not something he learned from his father - his mother on the other hand was not a Hill by birth.  So that's probably where he got it from.  She must be a black sheep in the family.  I'd only met her once and that was years ago, long before Chris could talk.

The boys will get a lesson in putting away food tonight, even the smell of smoke isn't going to keep away animals from our kill if we don't properly store it.  But that is for the boys to think about.  We might lose our food if no one thinks of it.

Dorian and Sage are still having no luck finding that fifth boy.  I'm beginning to wonder if he's real.  Things are getting a bit rowdy, I have to go deal with boys.  Food makes them hyper apparently.



# Aug 24, 2015 @ 4:45AM

The biggest part of this trip is to learn to survive on you and your team.  First thing to do is learn to survive.  Then you have to learn how to trust others.  We got the survival parts done, at least the lesson parts.  Today we break up into teams and we learn to trust one another. Because of Matt's issues Dylan swapped him for Bob.  Bob was happy because he got to be with James.  And Matt was happy to be with the boys he'd started hanging with.  All the outsiders were now together - including myself.

Trust games were annoying, but necessary.  We'd play the lead around the forest kinda like the whole blind conga line.  Individual leaded by the team.  There was the trust fall which was not hard, but it was difficult to trust people who thought you might hurt them.  And Matt wasn't going to trust most of the other boys.  I didn't mind that Matt was in my group now, but I felt it odd that Dylan felt the need to put the boy at ease.  Oh well what's done was done and Bob was happier with the other boys too.  He didn't really like me much.  We kinda clashed and liked to be the center of attention.  We drama queens do after all.

I'm going to wake the boys up early.  Matt's already stretching and stirring next to me.  He's either an early riser or gotten too use to waking up with me.  This would jolt the rest of the team, but it was necessary to build trust.



# Aug 24, 2015 @ 12:45PM

The boys were a little grumpy at me at first.  I told them,"The sooner we get through this the sooner you can all go back to your bed rolls or whatever you want. "  It was five boys and myself.  And to promote trust I participated too.  My teachers hadn't when I was in the Academy but I wasn't most teachers.  Trust wasn't demanded, it was earned.  I wanted them to trust I knew what I was doing, so I had to trust them.  And  trusting people wasn't my strong suit.

We were on the trust fall first.  Each team taking turns during the day to go through each obstacle together.  I went first and I will tell say that the boys didn't fail me.  Heights is not my favorite, but I've never let it stop me from anything.   So climbing up to the stand where we'd fall from had been the first hurdle I had to get through.  Oddly enough, Matt whispered in my ear, "You can do this." as if he'd known me my whole life.  I did do it.  I trusted them, and they trusted the rest of us.  It was rather anti-climatic if you think about it.  All these boys who didn't trust anyone any father than I could throw them, and they believed that they could trust each other. I didn't think I was that good of a teacher, but I'd take the ease of this exercise with a grain of salt.

The following two courses proved to be pretty much the same thing.  I went first, then the boys each took their turn.  We had a few mishaps where one of the boys didn't quite listen so well, and he ran into a tree stump and rammed his precious parts into the stump doubling over in pain.  Everyone apologized profusely, but I interjected afterwards.  "You need to listen better."  That was when my smart boy, engineer type, Jerry proclaimed he had trouble with his left from his right.  That would have been something we should have shared with the rest of the class in the beginning.

The next exercise went much better when everyone knew everyone's weakness.  We were done by lunch, and the five boys were playing a game of hide and seek in the woods.  While I sit here and write this and digest what I learned today.  

Maybe I should give this teaching thing a solid go.  Clearly I had something to offer.  I mean if Jace could teach my theories to a bunch of kids, shouldn't I be able to do it better?  Not that I wanted to take it away from Jace, but I was already teaching my little dragon things I didn't learn until I was 10 or 11 years old.  I wasn't fast tracking the dragon, I was going with his strengths.  Could I mentor an older child?  Be someone they looked up to?  If Matt was any indication I'd have to say yes to that.

There is yelling off in the distance.  I need to go check what it is.  All my boys are running in that direction as well.



# Aug 24, 2015 @ 7:30PM

Well, shit hit the fan.  That mountain lion that had been hanging around, hung around Trent's group while they were doing their thing.  John and Phil decided it would be a good idea to throw rocks at it.  Venatori strength means they hit pretty damn hard.  They thought that pelting the lion in the head was funny.  

The mountain lion got the last laugh and mauled John.  Trent shot it but it wasn't a kill shot.  That was the ruckus we heard - the boys chasing after the mountain lion like they could do anything with it.  The only one who hadn't chased after it in Team 2 was Chris.  He was doing the smart thing and tending to idiot boy's wounds.

Trent and his team want revenge, they want to go hunting said mountain lion.  Dylan has pretty much forbidden it.  And since he's leader of our rag-tag group his word is law - or so say the by-laws.  He's the most senior of the three of us - not only in age but in Boulder's wilderness.  

I expect that Team 2 is going to be trying to sneak off.  I told Dylan that he he smirked.  I'd like them see them get past you.  I quirked my eyebrow at him and he just laughed.  "Later."

John's claw marks were slow to fade.  They were healing but they weren't healing fast.  I didn't let anyone know that wasn't supposed to happen.  The only time that our bodies healed that slow from an animal mauling was when they were supernatural in nature.  No one caught it but me.  I was pretty sure my survival guru's out here had never actually be up against a real creature.  

I lent John my ability with the elements and watched the wound heal faster than it would have normally.  Everyone turned in early.  Trent's team going to rack sooner than the rest to actually catch a few z's before they tried to sneak out.  My boys were next to follow - mostly because they'd been up earlier than the rest and they had been running around the woods playing games.  Team building all their own.  My five outcasts were thicker than thieves after day one.

Dylan sent his crew to bed and he and I sat by the fire.  His hand strayed to my knee and he leaned close and whispered softly in my ear.  "Let's go someplace a little more private."  Everything about what Dylan looked like he was hitting on me.  That's what it felt like too.  His fingers playing against the skin of my legs just under the hem of my shorts.  He took my hand and hauled me after him.  I really didn't have much choice, unless I let him drag me, his grip was firm on my hand as we traipsed through the woods towards the creek.

Out of hearing range of every Venatori Dylan pulled me against a tree and pressed me to it.  He leaned in and his body lain against mine.  I swallowed hard and was about to say something when Dylan leaned in and whispered in my ear.  His breath tickling my neck and I couldn't help the reaction it elicited.  But his words were anything but sweet nothings, "Trent's faking sleep."

I nodded, and understood Dylan was making out with me to fool his friend - or many not so much his friend.  I let Dylan continue with his charade and knew that I was reacting the way I should despite the fact I truly wanted him away from me.  Ironically had this been before Sage I would have welcomed this closeness from the guy I crushed on for so long.

"You healed John, did you?"  He asked as he pressed his lips against my neck.

I nodded.  I didn't want to speak and let him know exactly how much he was affecting me.  "The mountain lion was a shifter."

I hissed softly, "Yes."  But it came out more of a moan than I'd have liked and I could feel the smile Dylan hid against my neck.  

"You are too easy."

I laughed, "Tell me about it."  I whispered back, "What are you doing about it?"

"Can you hold a wall of air in your sleep?"

I nodded and pulled Dylan closer with a fistful of his shirt.  If he wanted to play the game I would return the favor.  "I can."  I kissed his neck and felt the shiver run up his body.  

"I get your point, I'll behave."  He groaned out.  "Do it please."

I nodded and pushed him away from me with probably more force than needed.  Dylan's eyes were wide and I grinned at him playfully, "As much as I'd like to, I'm taken."  I turned and walked away and left Dylan behind me.  

He whispered so I could hear him before walking off, "You are such a tease."

I couldn't help but laugh silently to myself.  Dylan followed me back to camp and gave me the dirtiest look he could muster before he rolled over in his bedding to ignore me.  I put a wall of air around our camp.  Nothing would get in, and nothing would get out.  We were safe from the mountain lion, and he safe from us."  

I probably won't sleep much, but I have to at least try.



# Aug 25, 2015 @ 4:15AM

Nightmares came as they always do.  But I was awaken prematurely when there was a high pitched scream when one of the boys ran head long into my shield of air.  John was screaming.  He'd fallen backwards and landed wrong on his arm and it was bent awkwardly.  Trent was trying to get the boy to sit still when I stirred.

The look Trent gave me was not a pleasant one.  I wrapped the boy up in air and he screamed even louder waking every other boy up who hadn't been wakened by his screaming before.  I sighed. "I can gag him if you want."

Trent looked at John and asked, "Can you shut up?"

He nodded quickly and clamped his mouth shut and tried not to scream as Trent bent his arm back into place and set it for healing.  It would heal quickly but it could heal wrong and need to be rebroken.  It was always a problem with broken bones.  I knew the problem of broken bones all to fondly.  Jumping from the AU building had it's pit falls.

Dylan smiled at me and put his arm over my shoulder and laughed.  "I think John is accident prone."

I smiled at him and patted his hand with a smile and promptly moved it from my shoulder.  "I don't want rumors floating back to Sage."

Dylan laughed, "Sage reads your stuff, he already knows."

I raised an eyebrow.  "You are reading it?"

He nodded.  "It's rather entertaining."

I rolled my eyes.  "I think your memory though is a bit biased."

"It's my head, stay out of it." 

Dylan laughed.

Trent finished his work and came over to me and pulled his fist back and Dylan caught it before it hit me in the face.  Trent's words however did not stop in Dylan's grasp.  "Who the fuck do you think you are putting a wall of air around us?"

Dylan smiled.  "He did it on my order."

Trent stared at Dylan.  "Why would side with this fag?"

I sighed and I walked away. Dylan could deal with Trent.  My boys were sitting around the fire chatting with one another with Chris and and Nate sitting there.  I sat down with them and half heartedly listened to the seven of them and tried to ignore the conversation behind me.  I really didn't need Trent right now.



# Aug 25, 2015 @ 3:45PM

It hadn't taken long for things to settle with Trent and Dylan and we went about our day as usual.  Today was working as a team day 2 which meant the zip line a good rock climb where we all had to work together, and the obstacle course.  

No one fell. Though we almost had a splatter from the rock face when one of the anchors didn't hold Jerry at the end of the line.  But we had all be prepared and our ropes were secure and we managed to keep everyone from plummeting to the ground.

If we'd all fallen I would have cheated and used air and earth to save us, but I hadn't needed to.  It was a good day.  

We were all drained by the end of it.  We were done earlier than the other teams and the boys were all passed out on their  bags when Dylan's team came back  They were dirty and tired and none of them even bothered to clean up before they crashed on their own beds.  

Dylan and I sat at the fire waiting on Trent's team.  It was late afternoon and we were a little worried.  Dylan suggested we go out and look for them.  I agreed so I'll be back.



# Aug 25, 2015 @ 10:45PM

Dylan and I went out looking for Trent and his team together.  The boys stayed at camp inside a set perimeter and a wall of air Dylan insisted I erect.  He was worried about the werelion who might take revenge on the boys without any of us there.  We didn't want that. Thankfully the 10 boys were more than happy to just hang out by the fire.  They were already goofing off by the time we had left camp.

We checked the obvious places first.  The obstacle course, the zip line, the rock face.  But they weren't anywhere.  They didn't seem to be anywhere within the Venatori grounds.  Which meant they'd gone hunting for the therians who were in the woods.  And it meant that Trent knew exactly what had clawed at John, he'd known that it was supernatural but played dumb.

But There wasn't much we could do about it now, we had to find them before they killed innocents.  When I voiced the thought to Dylan he gave me a sad smile and told me, we had to help them.  That if we didn't they'd probably all die.

He told me then about the pack of therians living in these woods.  Apparently they are governed by a pack leader - Darwynn Randall, a former marine who served for years but when he was bitten he was dishonorably discharged.   The rumors say he was a hermit who took up living off the grid because he hated all things - including the supernatural - especially the supernatural.

Randall kinda had a cult following.  Other weres flocked to his beliefs - all hating what they'd become forming their own group in these very mountains.  No one's ever seen them, no one's ever really come to the truth, but every year, around this time, Darwynn Randall, kills an entire class of kids the Venatori send up here to learn survival.  It's his way of thinning the herd.  They call it Darwynn's Law.  

I don't know how much of it I believed, but Dylan seemed to believe it.  All of it.  Dylan confided, "I had thought we'd escaped it when the camp burnt down.  Things were different.  I'd been wrong.  I should have moved the class."

I didn't have anything to say to comfort him.  "So you asked for me?  Just in case?"

Dylan looked at me with wide eyes.  His shock was apparent.  He shook his head, but I could see the lie as he said them, "No.  Dae'lin sent you."

"She sent me.  Right?  You requested an experienced hunter to come with you.  You wanted someone like Kai or Emilio to come to hunt these things for you, to keep your class from dying.  You wanted a real hunter."

Dylan sighed.  "Trent was disappointed our request yielded you.  I knew Mick thought good things about you.  But she said you'd never make it as a hunter.  You were too caring, too soft."

"And yet, here I am.  The one Dae'lin sent to help you."

"I don't know why she sent a city hunter with us.  You were the only one free I guess."

I laughed.  "You think maybe, Dae'lin knows more than you?  She didn't send me to help you.  Well not specifically you and Trent."

"Then who?"

I grinned at Dylan.  "If the rumors are true, she sent me to keep the peace."

Dylan sighed.  "I'd heard you were friends with the monsters."

I took a few steps away from the Dylan and laughed, "I am more than friends with the monsters, Dylan."

I opened myself to the things around me.  The smells, the sounds, the sights.  The patterns of nature swirled and shifted with the breeze.  I felt the nausea rise from all the movement and waited for it to subside with my eyes closed but all my other senses opened.  I caught a whiff of Trent's cologne and headed in that direction.  I smelled fear too.

Dylan followed me.  I could hear his footsteps behind me, but he wasn't saying anything more.  I don't know if everything was all an act or if he was afraid of me now.  I could deal with the fear, but I wasn't sure I liked being played like that.  Though it would suit me just right because of the way I treated people.  Karma is a bitch.

We headed towards a cave.  I heard others nearby and the stench of fear was strong.  I also smelt wolf, and felt a weak and waning power.

Dylan stopped me by grabbing my hand and went first, gun drawn.  I sighed, "I don't need your protection."

Dylan frowned back at me, "Of the two of us, I'm expendable."

His comment made me pause, this was a first for me.  I was never the valuable one.  I was the no-nothing kid who liked the monsters we hunted.  I couldn't analyze it any further then, but now, I'm still at a loss of what he might have been thinking and I didn't have a mind to ask him.  I didn't want to know really.  It was a scary thought.

Dylan lead the way inside the cave.  I heard whimpering and boys taunting.  It was a familiar sound, I remembered when the man in front of me had kicked me in a similar fashion.  Him and his friends getting in on the action.  Dylan must have recognized the sound as well because he hurried deeper into the cave.

Deeper in we found three boys kicking another boy.  Patrick was holding Chris back from the other three boys while they kicked and taunted the boy on the ground.  He was curled up in a ball protecting the soft parts.  I could feel the wolf power ebbing inside of him.  He wasn't of age to change naturally which meant he was born a wolf.  Otherwise these boys would have had a werewolf on the ground and not a scraggly kid who probably hadn't done anything to them.  His clothes were dirty, his face was unwashed.  I swept my hand in front of me and the three boys were pinned to the cave wall with air.  They squawked and yelled but the look Dylan gave them stilled their tongues.

The wolf boy took off down the way Dylan and I had come without a warning.  Dylan turned and fired a shot before I could push his gun up towards the ceiling.  "He's just a boy, he can't turn, leave him alone."

"He's a werewolf.  He deserves to die."  Dylan spat at me.

"He's a boy. He's done nothing wrong."  I looked at the boys in the cave, "Where is Trent?"

Chris and Patrick had stopped what they were doing and stood watching us.  Patrick said, "He went looking for their camp.  He told us to get the boy to give us the information."

I asked, "Did he?"

Chris shook his head.  "No.  No one asked him."

I looked at Dylan.  "I'm going to take the boys back.  You look for Trent.  I don't have to remind you that neither of you are hunters, so once you find him you should return to camp.  I'll call HQ and have them send hunters out.  I expect the boy's pack will retaliate and the boys won't stand up to a pack full of pissed of werewolves."

The boys all left without a word.  We all walked back to the camp and it's wall of air protection.  I called Boulder HQ and told them about the situation.  They weren't in a hurry to send out help.  I didn't expect they would, but it was on their heads if they didn't.  And they didn't recall the class when I called the Academy to tell them the same thing.  They didn't care if they lost kids.  I wondered if Dorian knew…

I'm going to sleep this shitty day away not that my dreams are any better.

I woke up as usual and had myself a long yoga session by the creek - alone.  Matt was comfortable staying with the other boys and Dylan hadn't joined me.  As I was leaving a yawning Dylan came into view of my little orb of light.  He frowned at me and I walked past - so much for our friendly chatter.  I heard him stop behind me but I didn't care.  He called after me, "Nox?"

I stopped and turned around to look at him.  "Look, about the other day… Trent was out of line."

I shrugged.  "I've been called a fag before, it's not a big deal."  I turned and started walking.  

Dylan sighed, "That wasn't what I wanted to say."

I stopped by didn't turn around.  I was tired of the games.  I know something I did, and now I was tired of it.  This trip was making me see so many of my own faults.  Things I needed to change.  I turned around, "What did you want to say, Dylan?  You were sorry for siding with a bunch of boys who would kick another kid because he was different?  Cause you did it too.  You want to apologize for trying to kill a boy who didn't do anything wrong.  What exactly did you want to say Dylan, cause I can't wait to hear it."

"You're a real ass, you know that?"  Dylan said harshly.

I nodded.  "I do.  But see unlike you I don't judge people because they are different."

He took a step towards me and I took a step back, "Look Dylan.  I don't care if you have been being friendly because you wanted my help.  But all you had to do was ask.  I don't need your pity friendship, I'm perfectly fine being who I am."  I turned around and walked away.

Dylan spluttered, "I wasn't… It wasn't pity."  He sighed.  "Nox, stop.  Please?"  He begged.

I sighed and turned around for the last time and looked at my former crush.  How he had fallen.

"Dae'lin didn't send you here.  Gary did.  It's just as much a test for you, as it is for the boys.  Gary wanted to know if you could work your magic here, like you could in the city.  You brought down The Dragon.  That's a big deal.  He was one of the oldest and most powerful creatures, and you shot him in the head when it mattered.  Your alliances came in handy.  Dae'lin made me come here with you because she thought a familiar face would be helpful.  Less alienated.  I only agreed because I wanted to apologize to you.  I know I was an ass to you.  We all were, but we were stupid kids."  Dylan sighed, "I see you with those boys.  They love you.  They will probably continue to like you even after class is over.  Even my guys like you - with the exception of James who doesn't like any of us low born."

Dylan walked the rest of the distance.  "I'm sorry.  Really.  And I'm sorry about yesterday.  Gary sent you to make peace and I shot at a kid.  Old habits are hard to break."

I sighed, "You shot at kids regularly?"  I shook my head and turned back towards camp.  "We'll sit down and figure out a plan tonight after we get the games done.  They could learn a few things about scouting from today's games.  Then maybe they can be of more use finding the Therian camp so we can talk to them."

I didn't wait for Dylan to acknowledge my words I just walked away.  I wasn't here to make friends, and now it seemed I was here to stop a war between Darwynn Randall and the Venatori.  I was starting to see a trend.



# Aug 26, 2015 @ 11:30AM

We are breaking for lunch.  Today is all about capture the flag and paint ball.  It's a group effort, but we are doing a three way war.  Sadly, it typically ends up 2 against one.  Dylan and Trent's team have been teaming up against mine.  Which has been fine, their teams are learning to work together, but mine, they already do.  

First round we lost, my boys aren't the greatest athletes and it pretty much came down to a can I get away fast enough match.  The boys couldn't.

Second round ended in us getting the flag through sheer dumbassery by the other team.  They hadn't even bothered to hide it because they thought they could just take out the other boys.

We are on lunch now, and the other two teams are eating and goofing around.  My boys were planning and drawing in the dirt.  Jerry was off alone working on some contraption or another.  I wasn't even sure what he was doing.

Trent was brooding in his tent.  He didn't like the idea of being penned in the walls of air.  I didn't blame him, I didn't like it much either.  But there was a pack of wolves who were likely out to kill us.  And until someone died they wouldn't send any more help.

Dylan and I sat and talked about how to find their camp. I wasn't sure I wanted to go out there at all.  I just wanted them to leave us alone so we didn't kill them.

Dylan and I would leave at night and head out and look for them.  From the lay of the land I had a good feeling about where they were.  But after the mountain lion, and the boy in the cave I wasn't sure we were dealing with pack, but a collective.  Collective's didn't have pack bonds.  They were bound by loyalty, and there could be disention in the ranks.  The CCB was a collective.  Darwynn Randall was leading another one.  This was going to end badly.



# Aug 26, 2015 @ 11:35PM

The boys continued their thing.  We lost one out of the three matches.  

Dylan and I went out into the wood after dinner.  It was still light out, and I didn't want to be out after dark.  We went down into the valley and scouted around.  Trent was pissed at us for leaving without him, but we told him the truth.  He was hot headed, and someone had to stay with the boys.  He wasn't happy it was him but he agreed.  I expected he and the boys would be following, but I hoped they'd stay put.

You could see the tops of houses from the tops of the treelines down in the valley, but that was about it.  There was smoke billowing up but all else was relatively quiet.  Dylan whispered, "I didn't know this was here, how did you know?"

I shrugged.  I didn't have an answer, I just had a feeling. "It's off the well beaten path."

As we drew closer we could hear kids playing, and women talking.  But there were no male voices.  That didn't bode well.  I was about to mention it to Dylan when I saw the boy from the cave curled up next to the fire.  He was being ignored by the women and the children.  His wounds had healed but he still looked shaken.  I didn't blame him.

Dylan and I made our way back to camp after scouting the perimeter of the camp together.  Once we were out of range Dylan said to me, "There were no men there."

I was glad he'd noticed too.  I nodded, "That's not good."

Dylan asked, "Why?"

"They are probably out hunting us, and they know exactly where we are."

Dylan frowned and took off at a run.  He was faster than I was, but in the woods he had to slow down.  He outpaced me and by the time I caught sight of Dylan again, I heard war cries and gunshots and as I came into the view of the camp, I saw the wall of air keeping the boys safe, Trent was on the other side alone, and outnumbered.  Dylan was pulling out his gun and firing into the mass of wildlife that was attacking.  It wasn't just wolves and mountain lions, I saw a bear, two tigers and a rare jaguar.  It was mostly wolves that surrounded Trent and my make shift wall.  The boys stood ready inside with their own weapons but unless someone climbed over the invisible wall they were safe, my wall was holding.

I couldn't react fast enough as Trent's gun clicked empty and he was swarmed.  I swept Dylan aside with a weave of air, and I plowed through the therians with more air pushing them aside trying to get to the center of the pile.  But the damage was done all it took was one bite for Trent to be fated to die.

Dylan was pounding against his own personal wall of air as the therians turned on me.  All but the one who cradled Trent's head in his mouth.  It was the mountain lion from before, but he bore no wounds from being shot.  And those that had been shot by Dylan and Trent were limping away.  You can't shoot a therian with normal bullets and expect it to stay down.  Silver was only so good, but it was expensive and classed definitely didn't get rounds.  My weapons were on the inside of the wall of air, but I didn't need them.

The mountain lion dropped Trent to the ground and roared loud.  The therians retreated all but him.  I nodded to the large cat and took a few steps forward, "We should talk, Darwynn Randall, before more of us die."

None of them had died, but we were down one teacher.  The odds were looking to be in their favor, not ours.  The cat smiled and trotted off in the direction of their home.  I waited until the last of the footsteps away fell into silence before I let down the shields of air.  Everyone swarmed Trent's body.  I went and sat down by the fire.  We were in for a long night.



# Aug 27, 2015 @ 5:30AM

We gave Trent a Venatori burial.  Which consisted of a funeral pier and a celebration of his life.  So there were booze and drugs and just plain goofing off.  Normally there would be dancing and lots of sex.  Not orgy sex mind you.  Funerals always lead to nights of drunken debauchery.  But there were none of that here considering we were all guys and only three of us swung the other way.  

I had a beer and watched everyone have a good time.  Everyone was up late and everyone slept well past the time we needed to wake up.  But the obstacle course was not really going to take all day so it was alright.  Even I woke up later than usual.

Dylan didn't go swimming but I did my yoga. It helped with the stress.  We had a dead body - they would care now.  I wasn't looking forward to more hunters being here, there was going to be more blood shed.

Dylan called HQ as soon as I finished my workout.  I overheard him talking to them.  I was pretty sure he meant for me to hear.  "Yes, ma'am.  Trent was killed in action.  We need someone here asap."

I didn't hear the other end of the satilite phone that would require opening up my senses and I wasn't really in the mood to do that.  And I didn't really care what they said.  

Orders would come down.  The therians would die.  Every man woman and child involved would perish at the hands of whatever Venatori they sent.  And they'd probably drag all the boys into it.  Even the non-hunters.  It was a good learning experience.

Dylan nodded and hung up the phone.  "They are sending Mick and Kenny."  He had a half smile on his face, he got to see his girlfriend.  It had to be an interesting relationship because Dylna had a wife at home with his son Sam.  And he had his girlfriend out here in the woods.  I wondered if his wife knew.  I figured Mick new, she wan't the monogomous type.  She liked to have a good time, and her men came to her.  

Even I had had a good time with her despite our disagreements.

But I didn't know this Kenny.  I likely didn't want to.  Most hunters were like my father.  Shoot first.  Never ask questions.  They carried a gun, helpt silver, wood and hollow points on them at all times.  They never went hand to hand unless absolutely necessary.  And they knew only the basics about the creature, and how to kill it.  

We roused the boys and we ate breakfast, now we are off to run obstacles while we wait for the hunters to arrive.  If they were at Boulder HQ they'd be here at the end of the day, if they were out here in the woods somewhere, they could be days out.  We just didn't know right now.  We'd konw in a few hours after we got a call from Kenny or Mick what their eta was.  



# Aug 27, 2015 @ 2:35PM

We took a late lunch. Since we are down one teacher each team stayed together so Dylan and I could help them all.  Which meant it took much longer to get through everything. Some of the boys were weak and needed to help their team mates.  My little group of boys was doing well.  Trent's team was doing okay and Dylan's were still bickering - a lot of butting heads.  But they did manage to get through everything.

During the wall climb Dylan got a call and said that Mick and Kenny would be here at the end of the day.  What that meant we weren't exactly sure.  The boys wanted to go after the therians.  But we kept them to the camp area.  I did notice Tim sneaking away with another boy.  Thankfully it wasn't Matt.  I wondered if Tim has talked someone into being his play thing, or if Tim was the play thing.  I went to get up, Tim's record with me was not good.  But Dylan got up and held his hand out for me.  "I got it."  He followed the pair out into the woods…

Matt sat down with me, "Tim's a little whore."  

I laughed.  "I've been called worse."

"You did that?"  Matt indicated to the way Tim had gone.

"Worse."  I smiled at him.

"Isn't Sage worried?"

I nodded, "Everyday.  I'm worried about it myself."

He smiled.  "You are a smart man.  I wish my Dad understood."

"I wish mine did too."

"But you …"

"I just met my Dad a few years ago, we are still adjusting.  He and Drake get on well. which is helping us.  But it's still not perfect and he doesn't understand.  He still blames me for Nick.  And we have a whole history where we don't get along.  We view the world differently."

Matt nodded.  "You view the world different than everyone else."

I shrugged.  "I'm half human.  I see the world as different."

Dylan's just called everyone into the middle of the camp.  I think he's gonna give a speech or tell us what we are doing later.  I doubt it's to sing a little song about harmony. Or maybe it's hunter related.  Anyway, time to get back to work.



# Aug 27, 2015 @ 10:35PM

Dylan's important meeting was not really important.  He wanted to go over the rules of the class that we'd gone over in the beginning.  He reiterated that we were not here to deal with the local supernatural creatures.  As with every Academy training session away from the classroom.

But he wanted to see what the boys came up with in terms of a plan to attack their compound.  I listened.  But I didn't zip to participate.  Matt tried to sit with me and not participate but I wouldn't let him.  Dylan could decide to grade upon it so I told him to at least stand with them around the table and the orb of light I'd made as the sun went down.

No one bothered me but I was the first one to hear Michaela coming up behind the crowd at the table.  She was sneaking.  And I only heard her because I was sending my senses wide to watch for them, and weres.  

But I didn't pull down the air wall and she ran face first into it.  She yowled, "Fuck it, Nox I'm going to kill you!"

I stood up and walked around the crowd and smiled at my former handler.  "Hey Mick."  I grinned at her, "Password?"

"Asshole!"  

I laughed.  "I guess that's close enough, who's your friend?  I dropped the wall and reached in front of me and pulled Mick into a hug.  "Been a while."

"That hurt."  She punched me in the arm, "That's for the wall."  She smiled, "This is Kenny."  She smiled at Dylan, it was clear they were fond of each other, but beyond that she deferred to me, "Tell me what you got here."

I pointed at Dylan.  "That's what he's doing now.  it's his show."

She looked at me and then frowned, "But you are a hunter.  He's just a teacher, Nox. "

I shrugged.  "No one's going to do it my way anyway so why bother?"

"What's your way?"

"I don't know, maybe talk to them."  I sighed.

Michaela nodded then looked at Dylan.  Her frown dropped as she looked back at me.  "Let me hear what he's got,  then I'll listen to you."

"Whatever, Mick.  I'll be over there."  I smiled and patted her on the back, then I went to my bed roll.

I lay listening to the sounds around me after putting up a wall.  But Michaela must have thought I was asleep because she never came over to talk.  No big deal.  I had sleep to disturb anyway.



# Aug 28, 2015 @ 4:55AM

I woke up as I usually do – with nightmares.  But unlike usual I wasn't alone.  In front of me sitting by the still burning fire was Michaela.  She was watching me.  I think I caught a glint of a smile when I sat up and ran my fingers through the camo hair tips.  She waggled a finger at me and turned to face the fire.

She whispered, "I was wondering if you still woke early."

"Still do."  I agreed.  "Did you sleep?"

She nodded.  "I did.  I set an alarm."

I chuckled, "Why didn't you just wait for Dylan to wake?  Or ya know ask him since he's up before me most days."

"We didn't spend the night together.

"Why the fuck not?"  I asked.

"Kenny."

"You sleeping with him too?"

Mick snorted.  "Not on his life."

I gave her a wry smile.  "He is kinda … balding."  I said to be poliet.  He wasn't the most attracktive man I'd ever seen.  He wasn't ugly but he wasn't either of our type.

Mick giggled, "He's strict by the books.  No relations. He said as we hiked up here."

I rolled my eyes.  "What did you want to talk about?"  There was no way Mick was up with me just to catch up.

"Tell me what you want to do?"  She asked.

"I don't want to do anything.  I think you can talk with Darwynn.  He didn't seem to think I was joking when he left and I suggested it."

"You've spoken to him?"

"Not really.  I spoke at him, he was in lion form."

"You think peace is an option?"

I shrugged.  "I don't know.  He just wants to be left alone by everyone.  I don't think it's too much to ask as long as he abides by the Clandestine Providence.  It won't hurt to talk.  We can always kill him afterwards."

"If he doen'st kill you first."

I smiled. "Do you think that little of my abilities Michaela?"

She sighed.  "No, Nox.  I know what you are capable of, but a gun to your head is still dead."

"If he can get through my shields.  Do you think I haven't perfected that?"

"Show me?"

I laughed, "You want to shoot a gun at me in the middle of the night?"

She chuckled, "It would do them a lot of good to be startled awake like that.  But no, you are right.  Crossbow?"

"Okay."

She stared at me in disbelief, "Really?"

I nodded. "I trust my ability even if you don't."

"Okay." She said and stood up and walked to her gear and grabbed her cross bow and several bolts.

We went off into the woods a little distance away from camp.  Michaela had me stand in the middle of a clearing and she went off into the middle of the trees and found a good spot to shoot from.  She hid in bushes and thought I couldn't see her.  I shot a fireball at her just above her head the embers fell down on top of her and she sighed.  "I forget you can see me even though you can't do anything about it."

I grinned but said nothing.  She always underestimated my abilities as a Venatori.  

I wrapped myself in an air bubble laced with fibers of earth to make it stronger.  I charged it slightly with fire and electricity that would diable any electronics in the device around me.  I turned my phone off and put it in my pocket so I didn't fry it.  

I saw Mick do the same thing.  She knew me well enough to understand if I did something I did it for a reason.

She took aim and fired a bolt at my head and I just stood there.  She fired a second bold as quickly a she could reload it and aimed iat at the same spot.  It was faster then I could reload it, but not faster than a gun could fire, but it was fast enough, that both bolts ricochetted off into the trees after shattering against my air shield.  Tiny ripples shown against my shield.

I heard a gasp from a safe distance away.  Dylan and Matt were both watching.  Matt was still on his bedroll but Dylan was coming from the creek.  "Damn.  That could come in handy."

"It does."I said blandly.

Matt walked over and put his hand on the shield.  It sparked a little then cut out completely.  Mick saw the falling shield and shot a bolt at me and I smiled as I pulled up a wall around me and Matt and flung a blast of air at her.  

Matt grinned at me, "I didn't think that would work."

I smiled, "You are a ground.  You can counter anything I throw at you.  You just need training."

Matt asked, "Can you train me?"

I shrugged. "We can work on it.  But I'm not a ground.  I don't know if there has ever been a ground who could counter all the elements before."

Dylan walked over to us and I dropped the wall of air.  "He could be useful too if you ever went up against rogue Magnus."

"Or dragons, probably vampires too."  I shrugged. "He could be a null.  No one has ever actually done any testing."

Michaela added, "Null don't exist, Nox."

"Neither do grounds, or cesari until they do."  I shrugged.

"I guess you are right."  Michaela kissed Dylan on the lips and smiled at him fondly.  "We are going to do it Nox's way first."

Dylan nodded, "That's the orders aren't they."

Michaela nodded, "Handed down from Gary. But I didn't want anyone to know that so I listened first."

I smiled.  "It's always good to have a back up plan.  Because free will and all that."

And that was my eventful morning, all before 5am.



# Aug 28, 2015 @ 10:55PM

All day I've had this strange feeling I can't shake, but no matter how far I stretch my senses, I can't find anyone following us.

Two weeks in and the bulk of their grades start now.  Michaela took Trent's group out.  Dylan his and I took mine.  We were hiking out two days with the boys to get them out in the right direction.  There were three checkpoints.  Each time had to find their own, and then find camp.  So it was a 4 day hike for them after we left.  Four days of just adults, no boys around.  Not exactly something I was looking forward to.  But I had two days with my five boys.  

There really isn't much to go on right now.  Matt and I walked and talked about what it meant to be a null and how we might possibly test it.  In reality it was easy, all I had to do was talk to Ant.  Hell, I could just call him and he'd be here in an instant, there were so many shadows here I'm surprised my thoughts hadn't called him.  Sometimes they do, thankfully most of the time they don't.

Tomorrow we hike again all day.  Even my feet hurt and I wished for the nearby creek.  But camp consisted of their tents, and what food Jerry manage to trap before we left.  He set up snares around camp for the night.  He at least understood the need for food.  

Steven managed to bean a squirrel in the head and they had squirrel for dinner.  I declined and ate what I'd brought with me.  I wasn't going to eat a rodent – too much like rat for my tastes.  Yes I was being spoiled but I didn't care.  I only had to live like this for two days.  They had at minimum six.



# Aug 29, 2015 @ 10:55PM

Today went the same as yesterday.  The strange feeling and everything.  Woke up with the same nightmares, not really worth noting, but Matt woke the rest of the boys up when he woke up and there was little time to actually sit down and write anything here.  Apologies if you were worried love.  All is well.  

But tonight, the boys are on their own.  We set up camp with the last dredges of sunlight and then I left.  I left 5 very capable, I hoped, boys in the woods to find their check point.  

The good thing though, was that the funny feeling I had, stayed with me while I hiked back in the dark.  I was exhausted, but I needed to get away from the boys, at least a few hours.  So I hiked for about 3 back towards camp.  I got to use my own navigation skills.  But mostly I just followed our tracks back.  The boys were hardly great at hiding their trail.  They were noisy too.

I didn't even start a fire when I stopped, just pulled out my bedroll, laid it down and stared up at the stars.  I growled when a shadow blocked my view and that's when I noticed the naked man standing above me with a shit eating grin on his face.  "I could kill you now."

I smiled up at him.  "You could, but you won't."  I said with cheer.  "Though you might want to move, there are some precious jewels well within my reach."

He chuckled and backed away and I sat up and turned to face him as he squatted down on the ground in front of me.  He didn't look like he was going to shift, but I knew an Alpha could shift quickly and this was Darwynn Randall, Alpha of these here parts.  My redneck and hillbilly was a little rusty but I chuckled despite the fact Mr. Randall couldn't hear my thoughts.

I sighed and dug through my backpack and pulled out the large towel.  "It's distracting having a man naked in front of me.  I might be monogamous, but that's highly distracting still."  

I tossed the towel to the man in front of me.  He caught it and chuckled as he wrapped it around his midsection, "Better?"

I shrugged.  "I'm less distracted.  Better is relative.  I still don't know why you are following me."

"You said we could talk."

"Yeah.  I did.  You know they called in hunters."

He nodded. "We've got tails on all of them. Even those boys you just left."

I started to stand up but he held his hand out, "They are under strict orders to just watch and defend themselves."

"If you hurt those boys, any of them.  I won't be happy."

Darwynn smiled at me.  "Is that supposed to scare me?"

I laughed as I said it, "You won't like me when I'm angry."  Sage would be so proud.

Darwynn chuckled, "Really?  You went with that?"

I sighed, "Sorry.  My boyfriend likes to quote movies at me.  That's one of his favorites."

He arched an eyebrow.  "I guess the hair and make up should have keyed me into such things.  But you aren't like the others here.  Why?"

"Cause I'm not like all the others here."  I grinned at him.  "What do you want Darwynn?  Why do you keep killing us?  We hadn't hunted you for prior transgressions against us."

"You do so every winter.  Though it's never an all out hunt, it's like you all play a game with me.  Every Christmas we have to find a new home.  We are sick of it."

"So why burn our camp?"

"To let you know we were tired of moving."

I sighed.  "That makes little sense.  Why not just find a place you know we don't go?"

He interrupted. "You are every fucking where.  If you aren't others like us are.  We want nothing to do with your world.  We can't be human, we don't even try.  Leave us alone."

"So killing us makes sense.  You want us to hunt you?"  I asked confused.

"Dead is better than scared."

"You are delusional.  Fear makes you survive.  It's fundamental.  We can work something out."

Darwynn jumped and was on top of me before I could react.  He pinned me to the ground with large hands against my shoulders.  I couldn't help the panic that flared up.  My heart racing, my power forgotten in the adrenaline that now coursed through my body.  He stared down at me, "You kill us."

I watched helpless as he lifted one hand above his head and it shifted to a claw.  Long razor like nails formed, the bones in his hand deformed and I heared the sounds of them changing.  My heart raced, the fear fled and I smiled at him, turning to look into his gray eyes.  He was so close I could see the color of his eyes in the dim light of my orb that floated above us.  Some where, some how, I'd found my power without even trying.  "Go ahead.  Kill me.  Carry my head back as some trophy.  They won't miss me."  I taunted.  "Or..." I reached up and grabbed him around the neck and pulled him down and pressed my lips to his.

He jumped backwards.  "What the fuck?"

I sat up and grinned at him.  "The best fucking weapon I have against almost anyone is my sexuality.  I'm not shy.  You want to try that again, while you are standing there naked?"  The towel had slipped off when he jumped backwards.  "Or do you want to be a civilized person, and sit down and talk about it.  Or have you been in the woods too long to be civilized?"

He growled and transformed in front of me before he scampered off into the woods.  I didn't know what that meant... I didn't know if we would fight, or talk later.  All I knew was right now I needed to release some pent up fear... Hopefully my love is still awake... I ain't sharing that with the lot of you!



# Aug 30, 2015 @ 12:50PM

Even after an excellent night – no I'm not sharing those details :P I'm going to let you wonder what we did what we talked about.  I will tell you it was hot though. 

Okay, yeah...

Back to my story and not the sex... Even after my talk with Sage I still woke up with nightmares.  Less than usual, not enough to warrant a calming yoga session.  But I got up early and I started my hike back to camp.  I didn't have that strange feeling someone was following me.  I didn't much like that.  I was almost tempted to circle back to find the boys and watch them from a far but then I'd be tempted to help them so I didn't.

Just before I was about to take my lunch I found Darwynn standing against a tree waiting for me.  He was dressed in blue jeans and light blue t-shirt that made the strong marine body stand out.  I smiled at him and he stepped away from the tree and fell in step with me.  "I brought lunch."

I looked at him and he moved in another direction than I was going.  I followed, well I caught up to him, he let me.  We walked as equals.  That was a good start.  Among the therians, and most supernatural creatures appearances meant everything.  Darwynn was acknowledging I was his equal, not his lesser.  I wasn't going to die by his hand – at least not yet.

There was a fallen log that had a red checkered table cloth on it with a nice spread.  It smelled good from where I was when I saw it.  Darwynn waved a hand at one side of the makeshift table, "I hope you aren't a vegetarian."  He growled.

I was almost tempted to tell him I was, but the food looked delicious and I was tired of fire cooked foods made by boys.  I shook my head, "Right now, this looks like a great last meal."

I grinned at him when he started to stammer before he looked over at me. "Humor.  Sarcasm.  Understood."

I smiled.  "Probably something you need to get used to if you are going to talk to me."

"Noted."  He said as he sat down and took a leg of what looked like chicken but it was too small.  

I took a leg myself though I didn't really like game.  "Civilized lunch.  What did you want to talk about?"

Darwynn kept on eating, he didn't touch any of the vegetables, more like gourds on the spread so I didn't either.  It wasn't that I didn't like them I didn't want him to think I was some kind of health nut or something.

He finished his leg and I ate in silence waiting for him to answer.  He wiped his mouth with his hands then smiled at me. "Civilized.  I can be. More than you Venatori."

I grinned at him. "I can give you that.  But what can I help you with. Lunch wasn't just about saying I'm better than you."

Darwynn nodded, "Well that is part of it.  I don't think a boy like you can help me.  I called New York, asked the pack there.  They said you were some kinda freak Venatori.  No real pull with your own people, but connections everywhere else."

"You checked up on me."  I smiled. "I can't help with my people, but I they sent me here to try to help you."

Darwynn shook his head. "Kid, look.  You can't help.  The Venatori sent you here to die.  They send them all here to die."  He stood up and waved his hand over the food.  "Enjoy your last supper."  He walked off into the woods and I sat and stared off into the woods.   I left the food where it was and I started back to camp.  I had several more hours of light, and several more hours of walking after that.  I could be back at camp and dealing with this.  I wasn't sure who to believe.

I had a lot of time to think on my walk back.  I had a lot of time.  Dylan said I was sent here when they asked for help with all the kids dying around this time.  Gary sent me.  Darwynn said they send everyone here to die, so why did Dylan ask for a hunter?  He didn't want to die?  Or was this a set up?  Either way, these boys were all slated to die by the Venatori.  I was certain of that.  Why send anyone when you knew they always died.  

I hate the Venatori.  I truly do.  Barbaric and cruel and that's not even starting in on this particular deed.  Sacrificing kids!  That was not something I was going to tolerate.  Not even James and John deserved to die.

I walked back to camp and I collapsed on my bedroll and I tried to sleep but my head kept rolling so here I am talking to you.  Getting everything out of my head before I try to get some sleep.

I'm not sure there is anything I can do, other than save as many of these kids as I possibly can. I don't know if the strict orders were to stand, or really I was fucked.  I can't think I'm going to bed.



# Aug 31, 2015 @ 8:06AM

6 hours almost to the nose since I went to sleep.  Typical.  Though I suppose it could have been 4am still like it usually is.  But I guess I was so worn out I was able to sleep past it.

Shortly after I woke up Dylan and Michaela both stumbled into camp.  They were happy, holding hands.  I wondered where Kenny was, he was supposed to be here when I got back but I was so dead to the world I hadn't noticed.

Mick looked at me and smiled, "You look like shit."

"I feel like shit."  I sighed and stood up and started stretching.  

Michaela laughed, "Are you trying to tease me, or Dylan?"

I grinned. "Neither, my back hurts from sleeping on the ground."

"Aww, poor baby.  Too use to your posh apartment in New York."  Michaela teased.

I asked, "Where's Kenny?"

Mick's pretty white smile turned to a frown.  "I though you knew where he was."

I shook my head. "He wasn't here when I got here."

Dylan sighed and Michaela grabbed her flashlight.  The three of us set out to look for Kenny.  

Sad thing was, we didn't have to go far before the rotting stench of meat struck all our noses.  Michaela ran in the direction of the smell and I already knew what we would find.  Darwynn's warning or words had pretty much told me everyone was slated to die – even the two hunters called in.  I knew that now.  The most dangerous first.

Dylan followed quickly after Michaela.  I found them standing over the rotting remains of a man.  But you couldn't tell who he was based on his face.  There was nothing left of it.  I tried my best to keep the remnants of my dinner the night before from the ground.  I was thankful I managed, but Dylan didn't.

Michaela howled, "They will pay for this."

I frowned.  "They are going to go after us next, they will take the boys out last."

Michaela glared at me," How the fuck do you know?"

"That's what I'd do."

"And you are so in tune with supernatural creatures."  Michaela pulled her gun and pointed it at me.  "I should just shoot you now.  This is your fault."

Dylan was still retching into a bush but he pulled away from it and stepped between me and the gun.  "Mick, he's only here to help.  I swear."

"I met with Darwynn.  He followed me out and when I was alone we talked.  He said I was sent her to die."  

Dylan paled.  He fell to the ground.  "You mean they sent us all here to die."

I nodded. "Yeah, you were expendable. Nate and Chris were expendable.  Matt, Tim, John, James, all were expendable.  All to keep the peace in the Rocky Mountains."

"I'm only here so Gary can get rid of me."

Dylan sighed, "So what are we going to do?"

"We have to go get the boys. Bring them home safe."

Dylan nodded.  "I'll leave right now. They should be on their return hike now.  Still more than 2 days out, but you think they are okay?"

I shook my head.  "No, I don't.  Darwynn said he was watching us all.  Including my boys. They were under strict orders only watch and defend themselves."

"You trust him?"  Dylan asked.

"No more than I trust you."  I said flatly.

Dylan nodded.  "Then I guess we'll just have to do this and hope we can do something."

I nodded.  "Mick…" I looked around and I couldn't find her.  "Fuck.  Does she know where the camp is?"

Dylan started in that direction.  "I'll get her, you get the boys.  I'll catch up as soon as I can."

I didn't like the plan.  But really, my priority was the boys.  That's what I did.  I grabbed my bag and I started out for yet another two day hike into the woods.  I was going to be dead by the time this was over.  Either from exhaustion or at Darwynn's hands…



# Aug 31, 2015 @ 11:35PM

I was torn.  Torn between going after Nate, who was family by blood, Chris, who was family but choice, or the 5 boys who'd I'd been working so close with? 

My decision boiled down to going after the weakest team first.  Which was going to be Trent's team.  I trusted my boys to work together to get through this the easiest.  They were outsiders, but together they had formed a good team.  And I was going to trust them.  Trust them like they trusted me.

Dylan's team had Brock.  And Brock for whatever his shortcomings was going to protect those boys because that's what he did. He wasn't a linebacker just because he was good at it.  He had the sense to know when he was their only line of defense.  Nate was with him and he had a good head on his shoulders.  Together I hoped they could mount their own defense.  So that left the snob, the suck up, the cheerleader, the video game geek and the farm boy.  I loved Chris, but he wasn't a fighter.  He didn't like hunting.  He didn't like slaughtering animals.  He wasn't going to be much help.  None of those boys really were.  So I went after them first.

I ran when I could and walked when I couldn't.  I didn't stop for lunch.  Hell I hadn't even stopped for breakfast.  I had to stop to rest though.  It pained me to stop moving, but even I needed to rest and sleep.  Dylan hadn't caught up.  I wished we had GPS on us too.  I knew where all the boys were.  I was happy to see my little troup moving towards me.  Smart boys!  Dylan's team was still together, though they were in one spot.  I was hoping they had holed up someplace safe and weren't dead.  But Trent's boys were scattered.  I was fairly sure that they were attacked.  Two of the dots on my screen never moved.  The others ran wildly in every direction.  I was still miles from the nearest one but I needed sleep.  I was going to pass out if I didn't.  So I'm out for a few hours to sleep.  If you pray – pray for the boys.  If not, do whatever it is you do to bring them boys luck!



# Sept 1, 2015 @ 10:35AM

When I woke up I had only a few hours of sleep.  And then I started for the first boy who was closest.  He hadn't moved since the last time I had checked.  Which could be good, or very bad.  And when I got there it was very bad.  So fucking bad. The problem with the dots, you don't know who is who.  It's just tracking the location.  It was meant to prevent favortism.  

When I got there, I fell to my knees beside the shredded body. I didn't need any identifying marks to know who it was.  His dirty blonde hair was so like Jason's I just collapsed.  I couldn't even cry.  The farm boy I had watch grow up lay in a pile of blood stained clothes, and ripped apart by animals.  

Chris was a good boy.  How the fuck was I going to tell his parents?  Jason?  Oh yeah, we could have saved him.  But the Venatori decided to keep us here to die.  I can hear Jace yelling at me.  Why the fuck didn't get him out of there?  Jace is gonna hate me.

I don't know how long I sat there kneeling on the ground staring at the body.  I didn't even hear the footsteps behind me.  There was a firm hand on my shoulder and I waited for the claws to descend upon me.  I knew who was behind me just by the smell.  

But they never fell. Darwynn spoke softly, "I'm sorry.  I tried to stop the ritual.  But once it's set in motion, I have no control."

"Blood must have blood, it is the law, the nature of our world.  You understand."

I shrugged his hand off my shoulder.  "Blood must have blood.  But it doesn't need the blood of a thirteen year old who's only ambition in life was to see who could grow the biggest fucking pumpkin."

I stood up and wrapped my fallen family in air and I stood vigil over his body while it burned encased in the pocket of air I made.  I would take him home to his family.  He would have a Venatori burial.  I wasn't going to leave his body alone and untended a moment longer.

The fire burnt hot and quick in the oxygenated bubble and by 10:30 I was ready to go.  Darwynn never left my side, and he didn't say another word to me. My delay had cost me, but by staying in place I also gained an advantage.  Darwynn spoke softly, "There are more of you about."

I glanced down at my screen and saw five dots in a search formation.  I yelled.  "Over here." All five boys crashed through the brush at the sound of my voice.  They looked dirty and could use a shower, but I hugged each one of them.  Matt frowned.  "Who's that?"

"Chris."  I said softly.  He wrapped me in a hug but said nothing more.  I put my arm around his back.  "We can mourn later.  Right now, we have to get the rest of the boys."

Jerry nodded.  He handed me his compass and his phone.  "I've been tracking everyone."

I smiled and showed him my app.  "How many phones are working?"

I gave each of the boys the app, and handed Jerry the compass back.  Mike said, "I think we should split up."

Darwynn nodded. "I agree.  Let me help."

I shook my head.  "Your people are killing my boys."

"I'm going to help one way or the other."  He said flattly.  

Matt interrupted.  "He's right Nox.  We need all the help we can get.  I'll go with him.  You take Larry.  Jerry, Mike and Steve will stick together.  This way each group has a tracker device and we can find you."  Matt pointed to the first and closest dot, "You go here, take care of the body. You are the only one of us who can bring them back for a proper burial even if it's already done with fire.  Jerry and his group will go to this one.  It's closest and they will have more numbers with Dylan's team.  He and I will go after this one, here.  And when you are done, you go for the farthest one.  We'll all meet you with him."

The rest of the boys were nodding in agreement.   Darwynn was smiling brightly and he looked to me for the final okay.  I sighed.  "Fine. If any of you get dead I'll find a way to bring you back to life and kill you myself."

Matt grinned and wrapped his arms around me and whispered.  "I'll be okay.  I know you are freaking out over Chris."

"You better be." I didn't bother whispering.  I looked at Darwynn, "Anything happens to this one, and you will find that the incredible hulk has nothing on me."

And they went off in their respective directions while I finished with Chris' remains.  Then Larry and I were off to the next body.



# Sept 1, 2015 @ 10:55PM

Larry and I found John in worse condition than Chris.  It took a few hours to get there, and an hour or so to fully cremate the body.  I don't think I've had a more stressful day in my life.  I was ragged.  I sat on the ground for the hour just staring off into space.  Larry walked around the perimeter checking on me every so often.  I wanted to curl up and forget life for a few hours.  And I wanted to call Sage, but if I talked to him I would break.  I would collapse. So when he called I sent a text instead.  "I'm sorry love.  If I talk to you right now I'll break.  And I can't break right now."

Sage's response was quick.  "I understand.  Call me the first moment you can, love.  I'm here."

I knew he was.  I knew he'd be there when I broke.  But I had 13 other boys to watch after.  I had 13 other responsibilities.

We were going to stay here for a few hours and grab some shut eye.  I erected a wall of air and didn't even bother layout out my bedroll as I laid back to pass out.



# Sept 2, 2015 @ 12:35PM

I didn't really sleep.  Larry got a few a hours of sleep though, he was doing better.  

We headed to the dot farthest away.  And we caught up to him about lunch time.   Patrick was bleeding.  He wasn't bitten thankfully.  Scratched and mauled but not bitten.  I don't know how he got away.  But he was a live.  

"Tell me what happened Patrick."  I instructed while I wrapped him up in the elements so that he could heal faster.  Supernatural wounds were always slow to heal, and therian scratches are one of the hardest.

Patrick started.  "They came out of no where."  He looked up at me.  "Chris was at the back of the line.  He stood no chance as they attacked.  He was the first one down.  The rest of us scattered. I don't know what happened to the others.  One followed me.  He corned me.  But I shot him in the head.  It didn't kill him.  He was still breathing when I ran.  But I didn't think about it."

Larry asked, "How many where there?"

"Three maybe four."

"They got John too."  Larry said.

Our plan was sit still until the others came to us.  I threw up a wall of air and I leaned against a tree to take a nap.  I left my senses wide and hoped that the boys would be equipped if anything attacked.  But they had to get past the wall first.



# Sept 2, 2015 @ 8:45PM

My plans of sleeping were blown out of the water shortly after I'd drifted off to sleep.  A flurry of birds shot out of a bush and then a crash into my wall of air.  I jumped a mile and fell over startled.  The rest boys huddled behind me.  Larry and Patrick weren't the bravest of them, but at least they trusted me.

It took a while for the lump in the afternoon shadows rights it'self so we could make out his face and features.  He looked at me, and at the boys behnd me and he tried to run but when he looked back he directed our attention to that which chased him, a pair of lepoards stalked around the four of us.  I dropped my wall of air and walked towards the boy.  

It was the same scraggly boy I'd seen before in the cave, and around the fire in the Therian camp.  Why were they chasing him.  I walked slowly past him and set him behind me as the other boys crept behind me.  "I won't let them hurt you." I said quietly.  "Why are they chasing you?"

"I'm their sacrifice.  Just as you are."

"Wait, what?"  I threw my hands up in the air and a wall of air and earth formed around the four of us.  "They kill their own kind."

"Blood for blood."  He said with a small smile.  "You saved me before, your boys were supposed to kill me.  I was left for them to do so we could take revenge.  It is how it has been done for generations. I was chosen by lottery."

I sighed.  The Venatori weren't the only brutal race.  "What's your name?"

"Faelen."  He frowned, "What are you?"

"Well, first of all my name is Nox.  And I'm Magnus."

He shook his head, "You don't smell like any Venatori I've ever smelled."

I didn't know if that as a compliment or an insult.  I knew I smelled like a campfire, but I was pretty sure he didn't mean that.  

The two leopards crashed and clawed at my wall of air.  I shouted.  "I don't want to hurt you.  I will to protect these boys.  All of these boys.  Kids aren't sacrifices."

There was a growl from the far edge, and then I saw Matt and Tim coming towards us.  A mountain lion  burst through the trees and then shifted into man form in one fluid movement.  It was interesting watching a powerful Alpha do that.  Adrian and Dom had never shifted in front of me before.  Most shifts take a few minutes.  But I could feel the power flowing off of Darwynn.

He didn't turn to look at us.  "I got them."

I dropped my wall of air and the four boys gathered together and Matt pointed in a single direction.  They all seemed to defer to him.  The rest of the boys seemed to afraid to do much else.  Some Venatori hunters they'd make, I thought to myself. The three boys all started off at a run through the trees in the direction Matt had said.  He stared at me and I at him.  Darwynn growled, "Go."

Matt grabbed by arm and pulled me towards the way the others ran.  We ran until we found Phil, who was also being rescued by Dylan's team and the rest of my boys.  Jerry was proudly walking towards me.  He didn't see that the six of us were out of breath from exertion.  We made camp early and every single one of the boys huddled around me for support.  No one erected tents, they all slept in a ring around me, the boys on the edges opting to lay closer to their fellow student than they normally would have.  

I wove two walls, the out one was just a ring of fire, the second was a wall of air.  The visible fire put the boys at ease, but it also insure I wasn't going to sleep either.  Last thing I needed was to lose control of it.  But the boys were my priority.  They didn't seem to care that I had the lone werewolf boy with me.  He cowered against, but it was Matt who was talking to him, comforting him.  That boy was going to be a born leader, if he could just stand up for himself.

Dylan's group had faired only slightly better than Trent's.  They managed to not scatter, but they had injuries.  Thankful for Brock's good thinking as he ushered the boys into an old tree that was rotten on the inside.  They had only a small opening to defend.  When Jerry had arrived, they had shot the two wolves that had them cornered.  They ran off when I showed up.  Apparently throwing fireballs is not something they like.

Faelen rocked against me. Matt placed a blanket around him for warmth and comfort. I'm going to comfort those who will let me.  And rest – sleep won't happen tonight.



# Sept 3, 2015 @ 3:45AM

I must have slept because I woke with a start.  Not from a nightmare, something outside my ring of fire was throwing something at the wall of air.  All the boys were asleep.  Matt was curled around Faelen and protecting the wolf from whatever dreams he was having.

I stood up and steped between the boys and to the edge of the barrier and tried to see past the flame.  A small voice hissed at me, "Put it out and let me in."

I didn't do as he asked.  I recognized the lion's voice but my boys were safe right where they were, so I opened a barrier just lare enough for me to step through and I was between the fire and the air.  It was hot, almost too hot and almost brought back the pains of the fire breathing dragon that had tried to melt me.  

I stepped through the ring of fire without it phasing me.  The control of fire was my base instinct and when my night vision cleared past the fire I saw Darwynn huddled in a bush licking his wounds.  Literally.

I cocked my head to the side and he looked up at me.  "Best way to heal even in human form."

I nodded sleepily.  I wrapped him in a blanket of elements much like Matt had done with Faelen.  He shivered, "What the fuck was that?"

"Just let your body do what it does.  Were you followed?"

Darwynn shuddered a little as his wounds healed even quicker than usual.  "What the fuck is that?"

"Just your body healing.  It always feels like that just slower."  I said flatly as I knelt down in front of him.  "Were y ou followed?"

He shook his head.  "No why don't you let me in?  I could use a nap."

"I have one your boys in there.  Your sacraficial lamb."

Darwynn frowned.  "You weren't supposed to save him.  They took matters into their own hands."

"Who is they, Darwynn?  And you aren't getting close to those boys until you tell me why you sacrafice children so you can kill more children."

Darwynn sighed and sat down in the brush.  He was naked and it was just now that I saw that.  He wasn't concerned with it.  Most therians I'd met liked to be naked.  Even Sage felt comfortable walking around his house in nothing but his birthday suit.  But with a three-year-old in the house he'd started putting on boxers for modesty sake.  Not that Drake cared, dragons were shifters too and liked the feel of the air on their naked skin.

"At first, it was an accident.  Your boys killed our boys. The coallition fought back.  Slaughtered the boys and their teachers."

"The next year, the coallition wanted a game of sport so they killed another of your boys, to make them come after us."  

"Every year after that they chose a person to get caught by you and killed for sport.  The violence f  your youth is just as bad as ours.  And it became tradition."

I asked, "It's called Darwynn's Law."

Darwynn shook his head.  "No, it's not.  Darwynn's Law preculeds it from happening more than once a year.  I can't stop it Nox.  I've tried. But I can limit it.  Only a handful need to die.  It's the least of your worries.  We are a band who stays here, and we only kill you.  They keep sending groups to this camp for sport.  Figuring one group will evnetually kill us all.  Or so I assume.  Otherwise why sacrafice your kids to us."

I shrugged.  "I don't know.  But I intend to find out when I get home."

"They won't let you leave alive."

I laughed.  "Watch me."

"Nox, they out number you 30 to one."

I grinned, "How many of them can kill me while they burn? I'm not like other Venatori, Darwynn.  I'm not afraid of my power. I will protect these boys."

I added.  "If you continue to help me then I will let you inside to sleep, but if you touch Faelen even to pick his nose, I'll fry you where you stand."

Darwynn nodded, "I'm on your side on this."

I made an opening and Darwynn walked inside.  I moved my bag to the edge of our camp and let him sleep.  I paced back and forth.  I was getting nervous.  Where was Dylan and Michaela.  I had a funny feeling they had gone after the therian camp together and had done something stupid.



# Sept 3, 2015 @ 12:55PM

All the boys slept late except for Matt and Faelen.  They helped me get food ready for the rest of them.  Faelen kept staring at me from lowered eyes.  Everytime I'd catch him he'd lower his eyes and Matt would laugh.  

Matt sat down next to the wolf and whispered to him.  But he knew I could hear.  "Just ask him what's on your mind.  He doesn't bite.  At least not unless you ask him."

I tried not to laugh at the overheard comment as I boiled water for coffee.  I needed coffee.  I needed coffee bad.  

The blue eyed wolf asked shyly, "What are you?"

I didn't have a different answer than before.  "I'm half Venatori, half human.  I'm Cesari, a Magnus that can bend all four elements."

He shook his head, "You smell like a wolf."

I smiled.  "I've been told that before.  I'm part of a pack at home.  I guess that's what you smell."

"You smell like something else too. Something dangerous."

Matt laughed.  "He smells like fire."

Faelen nodded. "That's it."  He looked to Matt,"What is he?"

Matt shrugged, "He's Nox. He doesn't need another explanation."

I laughed.  "I like that."

Matt grinned, "I thought you might."

Darwynn was sitting at the edge of camp watching everything.  The boys all woke up slowly at the smell of coffee.  And I had to make two more pots before we were all done with breakfast.  

I sat down with them all around me. "Dylan was supposed to find us.  My priority is you guys.  My gut says we leave back to Boulder now.  But leaving Dylan and Michaela out here by themselves leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  So I'm leaving it up to a vote.  We aren't going after the therians.  We'll send up hunters, but I doubt HQ will send anyone until next year."

When I called for a find Dylan and Michaela they all raised their hands except Faelen and Darwynn. So I nodded, "You need to follow my instructions.  This is not a democracy.  I know some of you don't like me, but I do this for a living.  Mick and Dylan don't have trackers, they could be anywhere.  But I think they went to the therian camp to do something stupid."

Darwynn moved closer to the group with a towel wrapped around his body.  "I'll scout ahead, see if I can find their trail."

I nodded. "Alright."  He took that as a dismissal and he shifted in front of the boys.  Every single one of them jumped and then stared at the mountain lion looking back at them with brown eyes.  I dropped the wall and put ot the ring of fire and Darwynn growled which made the boys jump again as he took off in the direction of their camp.

I looked to Faelen, "Can you find your way home from here?"

He nodded.  "Yes.  But I don't want to go."

Matt wrapped his arm around the other boy and smiled, "We won't let anything happen to you."  

We all heard a few of the boys grump under their breathes, "I ain't helping that fleabag."

But I nodded and reassured Faelen.  "You are under my protection.  No one will hurt you. Not here not ever."

And so we packed up and started following Faelen through the woods.  Matt walked beside him, and I flaked him on the other side.  Off to find the wizard  the wonderful wizard of oz…. Sage you are so on my mind.

We were all a little strung out.  All a lot tired.  Faelen was quiet, but he clung to Matt's hand  while I lingered with each of the boys checking on each of them.  We hadn't been far from our original camp.  It was destroyed now though.  Much like the first one we'd come to earlier in the trip.  There wasn't anything left, and what was there was burning.  We took a break while I put out all the fires.  

When I sat down completely exhausted Matt asked, "You okay?"

"I'll be fine."  I said to him.  He gave me that smile that said I know you are lying but I'll let you maintain your dignity and not push.  He was a great kid. 

Faelen on the other hand spoke in a hushed whisper, "You look like shit."

I grinned at him.  "I'm just tired.  I'll be fine."  And it wasn't really a lie.  I was tired.  I was draining my power and all my reserve power was linked far away in New York.  Matt put his hand on mine as it rested on the log between us.  And the world just clicked into place again.  The fog of sleepless nights, the drain of power left.  I stared at him and saw the tiredness in his eyes and I yanked my hand from under his.  "I love that you want to help me.  But you need to stay strong, no one else is standing here taking the lead if something happens to me."

Matt grinned.  "And none of us will be standing here to lead if you fall.  Let me take some of it from you, Nox.  We'll do better together, than separate.  My mom always said she wished she could take me with her, to ground her when she needed it in the heat of the moment."

I grinned.  "You'd be dead too then."

Matt nodded sadly. "I know.  My dad blames me for it.  Said I could have saved her but I was a boy, she was protecting me."

"Like a parent should."  I said.

Matt smiled.  "My dad is a good man.  Like your father.  Tradition engrains them.  He says I have to follow mother in her footsteps.  It's why I'm here."

"No Matt, you aren't going to be a hunter.  Not if I have any say in it.  Not because I don't think you can, cause you can.  But you make better all around support.  Your gift, you can help others recover quickly.  You could work your magic on unsuspecting customers and they'd never know that as you relaxed them with a massage that you were healing their magics."

"You think I should be a masseuse?"

I grinned.  "No, it was an example.  You are a service, not a fighter.  Use that head of yours, don't hunt.  Half you boys need to find something else to do.  You aren't hunters.  Patrick should be going to MIT with Jerry to study engineering.  I want to see the two of you build a building that rivals the AU building or the Night Life in terms of supernatural tech.  Vampires who can walk in daylight has nothing on what the two of you can accomplish."

Patrick laughed, "My dad won't let me do that."

"He will.  Trust me."

Jerry asked, "Are you going to threaten our parents to make them do what you want?"

I shook my head.  "Nope.  I probably won't even talk to them.  I have the ear of the most powerful man you'll ever need in the Academy.  The one who tells your parents, what you need to be doing."

Nate laughed, "You are going to tell Dorian and he's going to retest isn't he?"

"Probably.  Look, our world isn't black and white, you don't just become hunter or scrin with your head in the books.  Be productive to our society – to the world.  I'm a hunter, because I had no choice.  I probably wouldn't be much good at anything else because I have to work my ass off to understand half my schooling.  None of you short of maybe Brock is made for this.  And honestly I hope Brock gets that NFL ride he wants.  But go to college, get that degree too.  Football only gets you so far."

I'm not sure how my feeling like shit turned into a speech about life and standards, but the boys all seemed a little bit better than they had been.  Except Matt, he'd taken my fatigue into him and he looked tired.  I smiled at him.  "Give it to the earth." I whispered to him.

He looked at me quizically.  "You can see what I do right?"

He nodded.  I put my hands into the dirt below us and I closed my eyes and summoned up the elements but I didn't use them.  I surrenered to them.  It's how you heal.  I surrender for them, and it heals the wounds.  But it works in reverse.  I didn't know how to tell that to Matt so I just showed him.

He said.  "I can't manipulate the elements."

"I know.  I'm not doing anything.  Just open up to it, relax.  Life wants to survive.  It needs to."

I watched Matt do it skeptically.  But he gasped when the elements swirled around him with a life of it's own and took the fatigue away, healed the little wounds that had lingered from the hike.  He hissed, "Wow."

I smiled, "Together then?"

He stood up and smiled back.  "Together."

He called to the rest of the group and took Faelen's hand and headed into the direction of camp.  We still hadn't found Dylan and Mick and their lives hung in the balance.



# Sept 4, 2015 @ 2:06AM

Shortly after my little speech we heard an explosion in the direction we were heading. Everyone ran in that direction.  We were still an hour out by the time we saw the billowing smoke it was too late.

I could smell the stench of burning flesh and hair.  The fire burned hot and it smelled like petroleum and other man made things.  There were no survivors.  Well I say that, but it's a lie.  I found a woman who's body was burning she was still alive, her therian blood kept her alive longer, her lungs hadn't burnt with the smoke.  But the burn marks on her body I knew.  Dragon's fire.  Or napalm – man made dragon's fire.  The stuff burns until there is nothing left to burn.  She wailed for me to help her.  I tried.  But It was too much to heal.  She begged and pleaded.  I told her I was sorry.  She whispered, "Kill me."  she whispered it over and over until I was certain that was what she said.

I had my gun out, Faelen was behind me.  He yelled when I pulled the trigger.  He scooped the dead woman up in his arms and glared at me heedless of the napalm he had on his skin.  He screamed even as I put the fire out with my power.  His arm and chest would scar, but he'd live.  I picked him up and carried him as I put out the fires all around us.  

Faelen had passed out in my arms.  I almost dropped the boy several times while I walked but he clung to me even as I stumbled to my knees.

There were no survivors.  And I didn't see anything that was recognizable as Dylan or Michaela, only women and children – burnt and dead.  there were no men in this villiage, they were out hunting us. And Michaela and Dylan killed their families....

At the edge of their little village I collapsed.  Matt said I passed out completely.  I woke up a few minutes ago.  My boys all around the fire sleeping.  Darwynn dressed and standing by the fire watching over us.  He spoke quietly when he saw me watching him.  "The rest are dead, the boy and I the only survivors.  There was no way we could survive against what they threw at us."

I sat up and put my head on my knees and closed my eyes.  It was hard to move, hard to breathe.  I asked when the nausea was swept away when Matt laid his hand on my leg, still asleep he knew I was in need.  "Are you going to retaliate?"

Darwyn knelt down in front of me, creating a dark silhouette in front of me against the bright fire.  "To what end.   So you can kill me?"

I sighed.  "Come back with me, help me fix this?"

Darwynn laughed as he stood up, "What's a boy like you going to do?"

I looked up at him with a smile.  "Come with me and find out."

Darwynn nodded once as he pulled his shirt off.  "I'll think about it.  I'm hungry.  I smelled a buck pass by not long ago."  He shifted and was off at a run now that I was awake. 

Michaela and Dylan were still missing, but right now I didn't care.  They could die for all I cared at the moment.  The boys were safe, and that was all I cared about.  



# Sept 4, 2015 @ 10:06AM

Darwyn came back with his buck, the boys helped him cook it and we ate well outside the ruined village.  I buried as many of the bodies I could.  Matt and Faelen helped me.  Respecting the dead of our fallen foes.  All of the boys filtered off into their little cliques.  The teams didn't stick together, it was their friends and nothing but their friends.  Even my group of boys who had worked together were all sitting alone.  Life went on, and they were waiting on me to take them back.  

Now that we have everything buttoned up here.  No forest fires, no corpses to be scavenged and stumbled upon by humans, we headed for Boulder.  



# Sept 4, 2015 @ 6:30PM

We are almost to HQ in Boulder.  Another 1 hour hike, but the boys all wanted to camp out one more night.  I think they were hoping that Dylan and Michaela would catch up with them.  I think they felt abandoned by them.  Left to die.  I didn't have the heart to tell them that they were.  That the Venatori knew about this.  They may not have been hand picked, but they had been sent here by the Academy to die.  I had every intention of finding out why we thought it was a good idea to sacrifice a bunch of boys to the fucking therians.  And why those therians weren't dead before now.

I was grateful that Michael and Dylan had killed those who attacked the boys.  But it devastated me that they killed their families first.  What kind of people do that?  They were innocent.  Their only flaw was that they were bitten or born into a world where they shifted at the full moon into a predeator.  It's a harsh reality.  The Venatori need to change.  I probably can't do much about it, but I have to try.  Killing our own to satisfy another race blood lust, just so they don't kill more.  And even the Therians were sacrificing their own for the stupid tradition.  

It makes me sick.  And …. I don't know and nothing.  This has to stop.

I still haven't called Sage.  I'm afraid of collapsing into a pile of goo the moment I hear his voice.  He's my safe place, my home.  He's my rock.  But right now, I need to be that rock.  I can't allow myself to implode.  

The boys are all hanging out together.  At least while the fire is burning bright, here is plenty of food.  Jerry rigged up some music, and they are dancing around like the boys in Lord of the Flies… that is the movie right?  

Even Faelen and Matt are out there, though Faelen is still attached pretty much at the hip to Matt.  But I don't think Matt minds.  He likes taking care of people that's one thing for certain.

Darwynn is watching outside the ring of firelight.  He keeps looking at me like he's trying to figure me out.  I smiled at him and he came to sit next to me.  We sat for a while just watching the boys.  "You think you can make a difference?" He said breaking the silence.

I shrugged.  "No.  Tradition and all that.  But I can't sit by and let 15 more boys die someplace else because of tradition.  Chris should be going home to see his family, work on the farm and grow the biggest damned pumpkin he can.  Instead I'm carrying him home in a plastic bag so his family can bury him properly."

Darwynn nodded, "I'll come.  I don't know how much help I'll be.  But I'll come.  If anything I'll be at your side when shit hits the fan." 

We sat in silence for a while longer, "Faelen likes you.  He likes Matt.  He has no family.  He had none to begin with.  He was turned a few years back.  He hasn't shifted yet.  He needs a pack."

I smiled.  "He'll have one.  It's small, but he'll belong.  He'll be loved and looked after.  We may not be be shifters but he has a pack.  And have the resources to make sure he grows up to be a productive member of wolf society.  Maybe not human, but I hope Sage can handle that."

Darwynn laughed, "I've never been to New York City.  I've never flown on a commercial plane either."

I smiled.  "Well don't sit next to me."  He looked at me curiously.  I grinned.  "I'm afraid of flying."

"Big bad hunter, afraid of flying?"

I laughed.  "You'll find I'm afraid of a lot of things."

Darwynn and I chatted until the boys all collapsed from exhaustion around the fire.  Tomorrow we are back in civilization and get to put this all behind us.  Tomorrow is a new day – the Venatori have a lot to answer for.  And I am not exactly how far I am willing to go to make them see the error of their ways.



# Sept 6, 2015 @ 4:45AM

Yesterday was a busy day, I didn't get a chance to hit the writing.  I didn't wake up with nightmares this morning.  My alarm actually woke me up.  Sage is still curled up in his bed sleeping.  He rolled over when my alarm went off after kissing me good morning.  I missed him.  I needed him.

So.  Yesterday we got back to HQ early in the morning.  We were able to book a flight for that afternoon and all of us were going to fly back to JFK and be back home in our own beds by 11:46PM.  It was late, but we were all okay with that.

While we waited for the vans to take us to the airport, we saw two familiar faces walking around HQ, hand in hand all kissy faced.  The boys all greeted them with fondness.  But I saw the surprised looks on their faces before they hid them behind the feigned happiness.  They had left the boys to die.  It made me wonder if Dylan's son was really in trouble, or if he was feigning that too.

Thankfully I got that answer.  Dylan came over to me and offered me his hand which I ignored.  He frowned at me, "I thought we were past that."

I smiled at him, "We were until you left 13 boys to die in the woods."

He paled a little.  "I had my orders."

"Yeah?  Be glad I don't have a gun handy or I'd shoot you in the head right now."

"Whatever.  I came over here to thank you about Sam.  Dr. Silverman accepted him as a patient and Lisa says he's doing better.  Still has nightmares and bleeds every night, but he's talking to her about it now.  Lisa is afraid.  I don't think I'll be coming out in the woods until we solve this."

I nodded.  I didn't want to tell Dylan I would help him.  Because I wasn't helping the bastard at all.  I was helping his son, a six year old boy who Garret was fucking over.  Dylan could rot in hell for all I cared.  I wished he could live through just one night of what Sam endured.  My goal was to check in with all those kids who I'd seen.  And I hoped to find that boy who we can't seem to locate.  Dorian and Sage were locking but I hadn't gotten any updates since before all this happened.  Maybe it'll all work out.

I shared a row with Matt and Faelen.  Faelen got the window seat – he was in heaven.  I was glad for his enthusiasm but I was still freaking the fuck out. Darwynn sat across the aisle from me.  I think he wanted to see me freaking out.  I thought I heard him chuckling from behind his magazine, but I ignored it.  Wait till he saw me in an elevator without Sage.

When we landed, the boys were all taken to the Academy.  Matt took Faelen with him – said he could bunk with him until we got things situated.  I definitely didn't have room for the wolf in my apartment.  Sage, my love, my light, met me at the airport.  He was waiting with my bag on his shoulder when I made it down to claim it.  His blue eyes sparkled and I had to keep my feelings in check when he wrapped his arms around me.  

He drove me to his house. We barely said a word.  His hand strayed to my leg or arm most of the ride.  Comforting me the only way he could.  He said that Drake was with my dad for the night.  He said, "I promised Drake you'd let him have cake for breakfast tomorrow.  It was the only way he'd stay with your dad."

I laughed, and then I felt the bubble break.  I didn't break down and cry, but I felt the world crash in on me long before Sage was helping me out of the car outside his house.  He carried my things inside and took them upstairs to his room.  He was grinning like a fool.  My things were finally almost completely in his house now.  

I didn't take off my clothes as I plopped down on his bed.  Sage touched my face and smiled down at me.  "You okay?"

I shook my head.  "No love, I'm not.  I need you."

He smiled brightly at me, "I'm not going anywhere."

I fell back on the bed and pulled Sage by his shirt with me.  His body pressed mine into the mattress and I kissed his neck then whispered into his ear, "You misunderstand.  I need you, love.  I need you inside me.  I need you."  

Sage's body shuddered on top of me, "I thought you'd never ask."

It wasn't the most perfect night, I broke down completely after releasing all that built up tension.  But I had no desire to leave afterwards.  Hell I curled up next to him, naked and we slept, I dreamt of him and for the first time in a while, the nightmares didn't scare me when they woke me.  Sure my heart was beating, my body was sore from the beatings, but I was still in Sage's bed.  He loved me.  I loved him, and together we could accomplish anything.  And I had a feeling that life was going to get even crazier now that I was on a mission to right the wrongs of the world.  Not because I was special but because those boys I saved were.  All of them are – everywhere.



# Paradise by the Dashboard Light? (NSFW)

Sage carried my things inside and took them upstairs to his room.  He was grinning like a fool.  My things were finally almost completely in his house now.  

I didn't take off my clothes as I plopped down on his bed.  Sage touched my face and smiled down at me.  "You okay?"

I shook my head.  "No love, I'm not.  I need you."

He smiled brightly at me, "I'm not going anywhere."

I fell back on the bed and pulled Sage by his shirt with me.  His body pressed mine into the mattress and I kissed his neck then whispered into his ear, "You misunderstand.  I need you, love.  I need you inside me.  I need you."  

Sage's body shuddered on top of me, "I thought you'd never ask."  He pressed his lips to my mouth and his tongue slide between my lips.  Things we'd done countless times before, but today, tonight they felt electric.  He pressed himself between my legs and ground his hips into mine.  He was hard against me and I felt my own cock twitch at the contact.

We kissed and ground against each other, finding the rhythm that we both liked.  His hot wet mouth against my neck made me moan.  I quivered underneath him.  My fingers found the hem of his t-shirt and I was pulling his shirt over his head.  He broke our kiss and Sage sat up, his legs spread around me and he looked at me.  

His eyes were dark with desire, the perfect blue I'd never seen in his eyes before.  My fingers played with the skin above his jeans at his hips as he unbuttoned them, and slide from the bed to remove them.  I sat up on my elbows and stared across my body at my love, naked in all his glory.  He wasn't overly muscled, but his body had good definition for a man who sat at a computer all day.  His abs looked amazing and the trail of hair down from his belly button was so fucking hot, I just wanted to lick all the way down until he was in my mouth.

Sage tugged at my shoes and pulled my jeans off.  He smiled down at me as he crawled back on top of me and pulled at my shirt.  I lifted my body so he could ease it past my shoulder blades.  His lips found mine once they were clear of my t-shirt but he stopped there, pinning my arms above my head.  I let out a soft moan as he played with the skin at my neck before he went down to my collar bone and left small nips before moving even farther down.  

His lips trailed kisses down until he was mouthing my cock through my boxers.  

In one quick movement Sage had them off and was back licking my cock.  Spreading my legs so he could put my balls in his mouth.  His tongue ravaging everything he could touch until he was running his tongue against my hole.  I squirmed and groaned as he slide it inside.  

I writhed under his ministrations as he slid a finger inside and took my cock in his mouth.  I almost came then.  But I took a few deep breathes and calmed myself.  "You don't need to do that love."  I breathed through moans as he found that one spot that made me see stars.  

He hummed his ascent and I had to fight the urge to release before he even got half way through with getting me ready.  He slid a second one inside and was fucking me and sucking on me and I wanted to – needed to.  With a slurping sound everything ceased and there was quiet and agnoy.  I couldn't see my love.  There was a moment of panic before I heard the tell tale signs of foil being ripped open.  Sage leaned over on the side of the bed and kissed me hard.  "I'm here love.  I'm not going to leave you."

He walked back around and I felt him crawl on the bed.  He reached up and pulled the t-shirt the remainder of the way off.  He smiled at me before he kissed me again licking my lips in parting when he sat up.  I watched as he slid the condom on his cock and applied lube.  He didn't wait long before he was pressing the head of his cock against my rim.  The pressure was intense.  I groaned at the intrusion.  I bit my lip hard as he puhsed inside so slowly.  I didn't know if was trying not to hurt me or to make it agonizingly painful in that glorious way.  Either way it felt fucking wonderful and when he was fully engaged he leaned down and kissed me hard, our tongues  entwining together.  Sage drank down my moan when he shifted do he could pull out.  I gasped when he pushed inside again biting his lip.

Sage moved slowly above me.  I thrust up meeting my love and he chuckled in my ear.  "So eager."

I whispered, "Harder."

He bit my neck and slammed his cock inside of me several times before he slowed and pulled out and pushed inside just as slowly.  I whined and Sage grinned down at me. I writhed under him.  He sat up and grabbed my legs and pulled me up into him.  The first thrust inside left me breathless.  But Sage continental hard and fast until we were both breathing hard.  He pumped again and his body shook with orgasm. I felt him pulse and I lost it seconds after him and spurt over my stomach.   Sage collapsed on top of me heedless of the mess.  He kissed me hard and I felt every last emotion drain out of me I wrapped my arms tight around my love and cried.  There was no questions he just held me till I could explain.  But that didn't come till morning. We fell asleep wrapped in ear others arms naked.  I didn't dream anything other than about my love.  I had no flee reaction.  I loved him.  More than I could ever fucking tell him.



# Nox's Report

The whole incident in the mountains didn't require a report.  It wasn't a hunting job but I still filed one. 

It wasn't much – well it was.  I filed a report dealing with day 1 to day end.  Which included notes on everything, and I gave them a link to the online blog thing Sage set up so they could read it in detail.  

I made notes on Dylan, Michaela and Trent.  Kenny I hadn't had much info on.  I wasn't even sure his body made it back from Colorado for a burial.  But that's on Mick and Dylan.

I wrote down all the information that I knew about the coalition that Darwynn ran.  I didn't know much but I put what I knew from Darwynn, and Faelen.

I reported on Faelen and made the formal request for his adoption in the same report.  I just used the same forms Dorian had filled out for Drake and hoped that was all I needed to do.  The boy was 16 and he didn't want to leave mine or Matt's side.

I also put in a request to mentor Matt officiallly.  All these things were included in my report.  

There was an immediate response upon it's submission.  Dae'lin sent me an email.  "Gary wants to talk to you asap!"  I left out the bits that Darwynn had told me, about all the little secret killings.  How they knew, how it was timed.  How it wasn't an accident. I wanted Gary to call me in.  I wanted to call him out on his hypocracy.  I wanted to tell him he was a bastard for killing boys like that.  He fucking sent my best friends nephew to die!  He sent my nephew to die.

But I wasn't going to go immediately. I wasn't an errand boy to do Gary's bidding, but I wasn't going make Dae'lin angry either.  There was a fine line here.  I couldn't piss them both off.



# Ignorance is Bliss

Gary's office was much like Dae'lin's they ran the field hunters together – splitting the hunters between them, and they had their own minions to do paper work and such.  Normally I'd be standing outside Dae'lin's office, but Gary had wanted to talk to me.  Dae'lin was watching me from the glass window in her office.  Her normally tanned skin was a little pale and I'd say almost green with worry.  She was nervous.  I don't know what she had to be nervous about.  It's not like she was about to get ripped a new one.

Gary sat in his office on the phone.  He wasn't actually talking to anyone as he typed away at his computer.  It made me wonder if he knew I could hear him.  His fake phone call was just to make me wait.  He wasn't Magnus, he wasn't my boss.  I out ranked him in everything but title.  That is the joys of being born what I was.  I may have been an orphan, no parents, no name, born to a human mother but I was Magnus.  And I was Cesari.  There were only two of us in existence at this present moment.  But I suspected there were others out there, they just never manifested.  

Gary hung up the phone with a slam.  Both he and Dae'lin kept the old fashioned handset/cradle pairs just for that purpose.  They liked being able to slam the phone down.  They had their own cell phones but they used the old ones just to make a show when they were angry.  I don't even think they worked for real.

He stood up and stomped to his door.  His green eyes stared at me with a fire I'd seen before.  This wasn't the first time this man had yelled at me.  I did my best not to smirk at his sneer.  He hated me.  He hated what I represented – change was a foreign concept to most Venatori.

"How dare you make me wait boy!  I requested your presence 20 minutes ago."

I shrugged, "Sorry I was taking a shit."  I said it with a perfectly straight face.

A vein in Gary's forehead started to throb as his face grew red.  The fire in his eyes grew brighter.  If he were Magnus I'd probably be on fire now.  But he wasn't, he didn't even have a useful mental gift – it was something like transcribing codes.  Which made him an excellent spy master, but beyond that it was useless for me.

Gary reached out to grab me but he thought better of it.  The last time Dae'lin did that I throw a very public temper tantrum.  Her words not mine.  I refused to be manhandled anymore by people who were not my better.

"In my office."  He said.  He didn't wait for me to follow and he didn't have to.  I didn't know why I was in trouble, I only knew that I was, and it had to do with my report I'd submitted.

I closed the door behind me but I didn't sit down.  I could have taken a military at-ease stance like most other Venatori would have with Gary, but I didn't I stood near the door ready to leave or move if things got violent.

Gary asked, "Why did you submit an uneeded report?"

"Because I felt it was necessary to record my perspective. And I wanted you to call me in here."

He looked up at that and there was a concerned look on his face. "Why did you want me to call you here?"

I smiled.  "Because I wanted to ask you if you really sent those boys out to die."

The vein started to throb again, his face turned purple.  "Wha… what?" He spluttered out like he was offended.  He was just covering his ass now.

"There is an unwavering agreement between you and the pack.  It's not written, but every year, at the same time a group of boys gets sent out to the same area.  They never come back." I stared at him with a frown that said I was disappointed in him. Like this was my meeting to run.

"How dare you accuse me of such things?" He got up from his desk and advanced on me. I backed up without hesitation and the door knob was jabbing into by body. His finger was pointed at my face and the vein was throbbing, and I had a clear view of it since he was six inches shorter than I was. I did my best not to smirk, but I knew I'd failed. People like Gary Kenyon always think I'm going to back down. That because I did for Dae'lin and Dorian I would do for them.

I stopped trying to hide my smirk and let it slid on to my lips. Which only made him angrier. "What's so funny boy?"

Shaking my head I smiled at him. "If you didn't do them, why are you so angry at me for even thinking it. Instead of denying it, offering up proof you had no idea what was going on. For the past 10 years you've been sending boys to their deaths. This time you fucked up, cause you sent me. Get rid of the trouble maker. I understand – perfect set up. Except you forget I like to make friends with the beasties, and that's exactly what I did. You slaughtered their families. Their homes burned to the ground, their women and children are dead because you let Michaela and Dylan have their revenge. Trent and Kenny didn't have to die. John and Chris definitely didn't have to die. There is no reason any of those people should be dead – except maybe you." I grinned at him and I took a step into his finger and he backed up. "You sent my nephew to die." I took another step closer and he went back again. I loomed over him but I showed no other display of power, and I could call all sorts of fun things to my back if I needed it. "You sent my best friend's nephew to die. You sent the grandson of our leader to die. You sent another ruling families son to die. You sent 15 boys, and two counselors to die. All because you fucked up?"

"What…. no?" Gary stammered he was used to me standing up for myself, for taking charge of the situation.

"You think I didn't do my research. To check up on what Darwynn told me, Gary? You think I'm that stupid to trust someone who I don't know?" I took a step back and sat down in the nearest chair. It wasn't the most comfortable thing in the world, but it was a chair and I was no longer threatening the man with my presence.

I smiled up at the angry man and continued. "There was a group of boys who went out. Their field instructor found a weak wolf man, he'd been attacked by a rival and had been left to die. You brought the man back and the boys beat the wolf to death. But you just left the body to rot outside of camp and when his friends came looking for him, they attacked you for killing him."

"None of that is in the report." He voice shook a little like he was nervous. If I could deduce what he'd done who else had. My question is who else cared… and I knew that answer – no one.

"I told you, Darwynn Randall told me the story, his side. I wanted your side."

Gary sat down in his swiveling chair, he was still angry. But he was calming down. "I didn't send those kids out…"

"You didn't stop them either. Who else knows why this keeps happening?" I asked calmly even though I knew I was going to blow a lid.

"No one knows why, but everyone knows it happens." There was a dark twinkle in his eyes, "Even Dorian knows." He smirked – he knew the relationship we have, he said it to rattle me. "We do what we must to survive. It is the name of the game."

"Sacrificing 15 boys is survival?" I would talk to Dorian. But I wasn't going to let that change the subject.

"Would you rather they attack every group?"

I sighed. "All you had to do was move to someplace else."

Gary laughed. "You would change millennia of tradition just because of some stupid group of therians decided to take up residence in our woods."

"Millennia of tradition? Who the fuck cares about tradition when you knowingly send boys to die! Do their lives not matter?"

"You will never understand, boy. You are too human." Gary shook his head, "We should have let the dragon's kill you instead when you were a baby."

"What?"

Gary laughed. "You think your mother didn't know? The dragon's came to us. Told us of the birth of Cesari. Sadly we let them kill the wrong twin. Such was their loss and ours." He laughed again, "You honestly think we didn't know? You are a delusional boy."

He stood up still laughing, but not as hard as he had been. "Your report has been noted. Now get out of my office." He waited for me to stand up and start for the door before he slammed me against the door jam. "You bring up the follies of my youth again, and I'll see to it that you find yourself under worse circumstances."

He glared at me with his hand pressing into my chest. I fought the urge to become that five year old boy, the one who would cower before his elders. But this man was worse that Garrett, he killed boys. He let it happen. He killed innocence. I didn't back down and neither did we. The only thing that stopped the standoff was a knock at the door.

A small boy of about ten was standing outside waiting. Gary's demeanor changed as he saw the boy. The red fury dissipated and he let me go. He opened the door and smiled at the boy, he was a diminutive image of his father. The boy asked, "Am I interrupting something, Father?" He looked at me and frowned. I can't imagine what he thought, the camo color still in my hair and the dark eyeliner. But I didn't need to know, they were all the same.

Gary shook his head and with a smile waved me away, "No, Lee, Mr. Sétanta was just leaving."

I nodded in assent and left through the open door. Gary shouted after me, "Remember what I said." I rolled my eyes. Like I could forget anything he said.



# The Truth Behind the Lies

The Venatori knew about the dragon's attempt on my life.  They gave Margo my sister.  The one thing the Venatori are is meticulous records keepers.  I knew I could go to the Archives and find the answers.  I knew Mrs. Vega would gladly help me.  But I wasn't sure I wanted to know the truth.

But I did go.  And once inside I found two of the Vega's standing together at the front desk.  Dorian looked like his mother in so many ways, and yet, his eyes were blue and his mothers green, but they were both stunning.  The smiled and Mrs. Vega waved at me.  "Nox, a pleasure to see you."  She greeted me, offering her hand which I took and kissed the third knuckle.

Dorian rolled his eyes.  "My mother is happily married and yet you still flirt with her."

I grinned at my friend and mentor, "I'd flirt with you if you let me."  I gave him a kiss on the check which he grunted at and pushed me aside.

"Boy, get off me."  He said with mock heat.

Mrs. Vega smiled at me, "What can I do to help you darling?"

I frowned.  "I want all the records relating to my mother and father and myself.  And I mean all of them."

Dorian frowned at me, "Why Nox?  I thought you'd come to terms with things."

I sighed.  "Did you know that the Venatori sends 15 boys into the woods knowing fully well they will die?"

Dorian's skin went pale as a sheet.  He gave me a small nod.  "Everyone does."

"Did you know my group I went out with was that group this year?"

Dorian shook his head.  "No. I had no…"  Dorian frowned. "Nox, no… I swear on my mother's life I did not know."

"But you knew they sent kids to die."

Dorian nodded.  "As I know a great many other disturbing things you find repulsive Nox."

I sighed.  "Did you know that the Venatori gave my sister to the dragons to kill?"

Mrs. Vega gasped covering Dorian's.  "Oh heavens," she cried.  "Nox, these things should never be told."

"So you knew."

She sighed.  "I remember when the dragons came to take the last cesari yes.  I knew of your sister.  I knew they'd spared you."

"So did everyone know and not tell me?"

Mrs. Vega leaned against the desk.  Her age showing as she frowned.  "Nox, you are so innocent in the ways of the Venatori.  You didn't have the guidance the others had.  Always strung between human and Venatori.  You don't understand."

I rolled my eyes.  "Fuck tradition.  I want those records.  You can help me, or I'll go find them myself."

Dorian was looking at me like he wanted to bitch slap me for back talking his mother.  The glare he gave me if they'd been daggers I was pretty sure I'd be dead.  But he said nothing.  Mrs. Vega walked around to the other side of the desk where she normally was and used the computer to search for the information.  She frowned and pulled out a card, placed it in the reader and then hit a button.  A quick buzz and whir later she handed it to me with a frown, "Anything and everything you are interested is on this card.  You're records are sealed, Nox.  Only the highest clearances to get into them.  I cannot grant you them, but this is everything.  But you can't see any of it."

I took the card and turned and fled without a good bye.  But I didn't need one Dorian was at my side walking with me.  I couldn't out walk or out run a Venatori even if I wanted to.  So once we were outside the Archive doors I stopped, "What Dorian?"

"Nox…"

I stopped him at my name.  "Look, you didn't know about the class' destination.  I believe you.  I'm not mad at you."

"Nox."

"Shut up and let me speak."  Dorian clamped his mouth shut with a roll of his eyes.  "This me, this whole bullshit cover up.  That's not you.  The fact that Gary wanted me out of his hair.  The fact that there are dead kids because of people like you who don't do shit when there is wrong going on.  I'm not mad at you Dorian.  You live the perfect Venatori life.  You are the perfect Venatori.  What am I some two-bit half Venatori who is barely good enough to pass through the classes because I'm half human.  I'm nothing here. But I'm not going to sit idle while the Venatori send innocent kids out to die.  I will not!"

During my rant Dorian's frown turned to a smile.  "Boy.  I'd tell you to let it drop to save your own skin, to just be Venatori, but I know you too well.  If I tell you no, you will go head strong into harder than if I just let you go.  Be careful, Nox.  This is a hornets nest you don't want to kick down."

"Thanks for the warning, Dorian.  But this hornets nest needs a swift kick in the ass!"  I smiled at my friend to take the sting from y words.  "Tell your mother I'm sorry and thank you."

Dorian nodded as I left he called after me, "She already forgave you."



# Stop the Maddness

Everything was spinning when I left Dorian.  I needed to sit down half way up the stairs to my room.  The world kept shaking me to the core.  I turned the card in my hand over and over.  It was just data – my life – my entire life.  Everything in it.  But I had bigger problems to deal with than my own problems.  I had to talk with Jace.  I had to deal with Darwynn, he was staying Adrian right now.  I had Faelen with Matt to deal with.  I had too much to deal with.  And now I needed to prevent more boys and girls from getting hurt. Because it wasn't going to stop.

It had been pretty much go go go since I left Sage's house.  A perfect night together – granted there were tears, but not bad ones – not really, and I hadn't had a chance to even say hi.  I sent him a text, "Go out tonight?  Wherever you want.  8pm?"

I was outside when my phone buzzed a notification for a reply from Sage.  It always made me smile when I heard the small ping go off.  "Sounds great! 8.  I'll make a reservation.  Dress nice."

I groaned at the dress nice part, there was no telling where he was going to take me out.  But I didn't really have time to deal with it right now.  I had to hop a train to Adrian's place so that I could fetch Darwynn.  He had to make the rounds or risk getting kicked out.  And I had something I wanted to talk to him about anyway.

Adrian's house doubled as he place of work.  Around back you could go in discretely for a session.  Adrian was a psychologist who focused on sex issues.  If you and your lady couldn't get it up anymore, Adrian helped you fix that.  If you happened to like your sex a little kinkier, Adrian could help you with that too.  He was one of the few sex ed teachers in the city who also taught people about the BSDM lifestyle.  I had a feeling Darwynn would be ready to find a new place to stay.

And I was right, I knocked on Adrian's front door and Leah answered with a bright smile.  "Nox, darling, we were about to call you."  She opened the door wider for me and I stepped inside.  She wrapped her arms around me and whispered, "I think our guest would find himself more comfortable elsewhere."

I smiled and hugged Leah.  "We'll find him a place to stay.  He has to check with the CCB anyway, Marshall will help I'm sure."

Leah nodded and lead the way into her living room.  "Darwynn, look who's here."  She smiled brightly and Darwynn looked a little gun shy as he looked up, but the relief flooded his features and his smile and eyes grew bright.

He didn't say anything but he was ready to leave their hospitality.  Being a supernatural creature with exceptional hearing and smell made living in a place of sex rather much if you weren't used to it.  I could hear Adrian downstairs with a D/s pair.  A normal human couldn't, but there was only so much sound proofing one could do to supernatural ears.

"Let's go talk with Marshall, he'll put you up someplace a little less friendly."  I grinned at Darwynn and his smile faded only a moment before he stood up and walked to the door to grab his bag.

"Thank you Ms. Leah.  Tell Adrian I appreciate all he's done for me."  Darwynn extended his hand and smiled at her.

"A pleasure.  A friend of Nox's is most definitely a friend of ours."  She said as she shook Darywnn's hand.  "Do come back on a less eventful day.  It would be an honor to hunt with you."

That was the wolf's way of saying welcome to the family.  Darwynn nodded his thanks and headed for the door.  "Tell Adrian, next time don't scare away my friends with his playmates."

Darwynn turned around and he was not doing a good job of blushings, though his face was shocked and he was trying to hide that.  "It's…"

I grinned at him.  "Look, lover, if I thought I had another place for you to stay I'd have let you stay there.  I'm sorry Adrian was booked last night and today."

"How did…"

I interrupted, "You look like you got very little sleep.  And I know what Adrian does for a living, I was a client at one time."

He stopped and stared at me like I was an alien.  He shook his head.  "What's a boy like you need with a man like that?"

I laughed. "Adrian taught me how not to be a victim."

"You mean you weren't always so cocky?"  He laughed.

"No, I've always been cocky.  I just learned how to cope when someone decided to call my bluff."  I grinned at him as we walked down the street.  "I had a rough start, and I had certain triggers I needed to learn to get past or I'd have ended up worse than Faelen."

"You mean dead?"  Darwynn asked.

"Most likely."  I shrugged.  "I had a mouth, I'm half human in a supernatural world, I had been taught early to submit completely and unerringly to my betters.  I didn't know I had a choice in the matter.  Adrian taught me I did, taught me to say no. Taught me rules I could live by to have the kind of life I wanted and maintain control of it."

"I can't see you giving up any control."

I smiled.  "Then I'm doing it right."  I tapped him on the arm and pointed to a set of glass doors in one of the taller building in the city.  "The CCB is this way."

"You know a lot of people don't you?  Leah was saying Adrian and the local pack leader get along because of your intervention.  Said you actually know Il Cane."

I laughed.  "I've not actually  met her.  I know her son intimately.  He's a good friend."

"Intimately…."  His eyes grew wide.  "Do you sleep with everyone you meet?  Should I be worried?"

"No.  I offered to feed Ant, his mother has strong empathic powers, but he does not, but the line is still strong and he can't control his bit like most vampires.  And I like men, when he fed from me, I took it to the next level and he went with it."

"Why would you feed a vampire, doesn't that kill Venatori?"  He asked.

But there was a man in a dark gray suit standing in the shadows of the empty stair well.  His dark brown hair was too dark, his skin too pale and he looked a little hungry.  "He feeds us because that is all he has to offer us.  He is but a mere pawn in the game of vampires and werewolves."

I groaned.  "Desmond, I need to speak with Marshall, not you."

"Marshall, is busy boy.  I can deal with your lion friend here.  For a price."

"I want to speak to Marshall, Desmond.  We can wait."

The vampire pouted.  "You never come to see me!"  And in that instant he was flying up the stairs at vampire speed.

"Don't mind him, he's an asshole on a good day.  But he's harmless.  He thinks he rules the city.  But Del Figlio does; he's only notable because he's council and a master in his own right, and his Chevalier is one of the richest men in New York City. And together they fund the CCB.  They don't run it, that's James Wright."

"So why aren't we meeting with him?"

I grinned.  "I don't know him."

"But you know the richest man in New York City?"  Darwynn's disbelif only added to the irony.

"No I don't know the richest man in New York City – that would be Asher Eriksen – he's Venatori.  Marshall is second richest."

"And you know him on a first name basis."

I laughed, "He's a wolf.  I know every high born wolf in New York City.  It's how the three so-called packs get along.  Intermediaries – the vampires and myself."

"What's a Venatori doing meddling in werewolf disputes?"

"I need to know who to go to in which neighborhoods, so that when I have a mark I know the full story.  I don't kill my marks, Darwynn.  I take them to the people who can help them.  If they aren't a lost kid and are killing for pleasure I take them to the Venatori and let them kill them, but even then I give them to the leader of their neighborhood, be it vamp, or wolf.  CCB has no territory here.  Just this building and their havens."

"So why bother letting them know I'm in town?"

"Because it's how we keep the peace.  You aren't a wolf, so you can't swear fealty to Adrian or Dom.  Your only option is the CCB, and Marshall is your way in.  All vamps swear fealty to either Desmond or Ant, if you are lucky enough to corner Bernstein that'll do too. If you are a Dragon, you keep quiet or join the CCB.  Most dragons right now claim loyalty only to the Dragon council so they keep quiet."

"What about others?  Do they know to do this?  I'm new here how would I know to find the CCB?"

"Someone would have found you and brought you to James.  James might kill you then for not coming to him right away."

"Tough life this city life."

I knocked on a door and a small voice called "Come in."

We opened the door and a small bird like woman looked back at us.  I gave her a little wave and she blushed.  "Petra."  I said as I took her hand from her desk and kissed it.  "I need to speak with Marshall."

"Mr. Vallejo told me to tell you Mr. Kent is busy and he would be glad to see you in his Chevalier's stead."

I sighed.  "I have to register a Therian – mountain lion class.  Can Desmond help me with that?"

She shook her head.  "No, Master Wright says – the vampire has no rights here – he's dead."

I grinned.  "I need to seep with Marshall then, Petra.  This is Darwynn Randall.  He's …"

She interrupted me, "Oh we've heard of you Mr. Randall.  Please come, I will get Mr. Kent immediately."  She lead us into Marshall's empty office.  "Please sit, make yourself comfortable, Mr. Kent will be right with you."

They've heard of me?"  Darwynn asked.

"Anyone who kills Venatori is CCB heroes."  I said flatly.  "Speaking of which I need you to think about something."

"What's that boy?" He said with mock outrage.

"I'd like to send you out to various other camp sites when classes go out.  Tame the beasts, or at the  very least let me know the things that go down out there.  No more kids need to die because of some petty feud. "

"You think to right centuries of tradition?"

I shook my head.  "I seek to right the deaths of innocent children everywhere."

"Noble.  What can I do about it?  I'm nothing."

I smiled.  "Tell me, is all I ask.  I'll give you a location, I'll fund the flight and the travel expenses, you be my eyes and ears and I'll do the rest."

"What makes you think that will make a difference?"

"Just think about it.  Think of it as a free vacation, and a means to look for a new home for you and your cause while relaying a little information back to me."

"Why should I help you, Nox?"

The doors to the office opened and a blond haired blue eyed man walked in.  He was stunning, as usual.  His suit was properly pressed and starched and he looked like he was made of money.  He smiled and spoke softly, "Helping Nox, helps yourself.  The most powerful Venatori is not the man who sits on the throne dear lion."

I rolled my eyes.  "Marshall, Darwynn Randall.  Dawywwn, Marshall Kent.  Our liaison to the CCB."

"It is my honor to sponsor your membership into the Creed of Celestial Beings on behalf of our friend here.  He does more good for our kind than all of his combined. How do you think we became the most peaceful supernatural city on the planet."

"Because the Venatori sit on your doorstep?"  Darwynn said sarcastically.

"You would think that, and the world believes it. Peace isn't held by that, trust me. "

Darwynn laughed, "You're telling me this scrawny boy keeps the peace."

Marshall joined him in his laughed, "For heaven's no.  It is not this boy who keeps the peace, it is the bonds he forges.  He's tied to the most powerful vampire in the city.  He's tied to an Alpha wolf in the city.  He is the strongest Cesari to ever grace this city with his fire.  The boy simply needs to take his place as rightful king and this city would find peace."

Darwynn asked, "And how does he take his rightful place?"

I frowned, I knew the answer.  I've always known the answer.  Marshal smirked as he said, "My killing the false king."

"He's not a false king, he's not a king at all, Marshall.  He's the leader of the Venatori.  And I will not kill Mark Green."

"Such a pity." A voice from the other side of the door said as Desmond walked in. "You see Marshall, he is no king.  A puppet maybe, for the son to pull the strings, or maybe the wolves.  The dragons can call the would-be usurper.  He's nothing.  Il Cane dotes on a boy because he might be prophecy fulfilled.  What does she know? She's insane."

"Can we move on?  I've heard you two bicker about this for hours before.  Darwynn needs clean passage in the city, in and out for as long as he wishes.  Can you get it for me?"

Marshall smiled, "And down to business, my boy.  What will I get in return?"

"What do you want, Marshall?"

"What does everyone want from boy?"  Demsond laughed.

"I don't know you tell me, since you seem to know."

He flashed his fangs at me with a hiss.  "Your blood fool boy."  He lunged at me only to be stopped by a wall of air.

I grinned at him.  "You think I'm stupid Desmond?"

The vampire pouted – again.  Marshall laughed.  "While my master is correct, he will not be partaking of the gift you bestow upon us."

"Then what do you want it for?"  I asked.

"That, my friend, is none of your business."  He held up a syringe and smiled, "Do we have a deal?"

"I'd rather he bit me than you stick that thing in my arm."

The look on Desmond's face was priceless but he looked at Marshal and it was washed away in a moment.  He sighed and turned to me, "I will ease the fear.  Close your eyes and let me touch you. Fear will not sustain me but it will be a mere taste of what you offer."

I sighed and dropped the wall of air.  Desmond touched my arm and I felt him shudder and gasp, "Drop you shield, Nox, so I can feed from it all," he begged.

I sighed and let go.  It was the least I could do for the favor he was doing.  Desmond fell to his knees as my shield fell, his head rested against my arm and Marshall deftly wrapped the cord around my other arm and drew blood quickly.  I felt nothing but the warmth of vampiric power coursing through me.  Desmond was an empath – he fed on emotion.  He gasped when he let go and dropped to all fours. "By the gods…."  he whispered.

Marshall handed Darwynn a sighed form, "Leave it with Petra and welcome to the New York Branch of the CCB.  May the heavens ever guide you."

I stood up and put my hand on Desmond and whispered, "Thank you."

He looked up at me with a frown, "It is I who should thank you. I have never felt so much pain except for that in Il Cane."  He smiled then, "It is a glorious feed."

We walked out and Petra took the paper from Darwynn's hand and smiled at me, "Next time bring a flower."

I grinned at her and formed a pattern of a flower.  It would never die, or wilt or wither, it would just be."  I handed Petra the white daisy with a smile and she stared at me in awe.

Darwynn laughed, "Do you charm everyone you meet?"

I shrugged.  "Not everyone."

We walked down the stairs in silence and out the building and my phone rang.  "Petra?"

She giggled, "Mr. Kent has sent an address of a safe haven to Mr. Randall's phone.  And he has a meeting with Mr. Wright tomorrow at 8am sharp.  He cannot miss it."

"Thanks, Petra.  Tell Marshall thanks."

"He said to thank you.  You're gift will be most useful."  And then she hung up.  I wondered what they wanted my blood for if not to feed on.  Desmond had taken my fear but thinking on it now I shuddered.  I hadn't panicked then but I would probably now that I was thinking about it again.

I really needed to see Sage sooner rather than later.  Darwynn interrupted my thoughts.  "I think I can find my new place and make the meeting.  I'll think on what you asked me.  I have your number.  You keep in touch oh prophesied one."

I rolled my eyes, "Can you forget you heard that from those two?"

Darwynn nodded, "Not on your life."  he grinned at me and waved.  "May your hunt be true."

"May the moon guide you."

Darwynn laughed as he rounded the corner.  I don't think expected me to say the proper good-bye.



# I Missed You

I had plenty of time to kill before I was to meet up with Sage at 8.  I saw Drake for the first time and told him I would come get him at Poppi's place so that he could sleep with us tonight.  I hoped Sage didn't mind.  I sent him a text asking him to make sure I wasn't making promises I couldn't keep.  He responded with a resounding of course.  

And then I stopped in to see Matt and Faelen.  They were off in their own little world in the common room of the boys dorms.  Faelen was curled up against Matt while Matt read a book.  Faelen picked his eyes up when I knelt down next to them and he gave me a happy smile.  "Do you want to stay with pack tonight?"

He smiled and gave me a nod.  I looked at Matt who was smile.  "You want to come spend the night with him at Sage's?"

Matt nodded, "I'll see if I can get a pass from my Dad.  He seems overly eager to please me since I came back."

"You lived.  That means a lot.  And I'm sure he got word of my glowing report about your actions."  

Matt laughed.  "I guess.  I heard you got yelled at."

I shrugged.  "Nothing new.  I'm going to dinner with Sage at 8. We'll stop by afterwards and you can meet the rest of the family."

Matt smiled, "Am I part of that family then?"

I nodded.  "Yeah, Matt you are.  You might not be mine on paper but you'll be family none-the-less."

He brightened.  "I'll keep him safe till you come back for us then."

I patted him on the head and ruffled his hair. "I know you will."

With all of that taken care of I still had time for a shower, to change the color of my hair from the camo to sapphire blue, paint my nails the same matching color and put on a pair of black jeans and the only dress shirt I owned.  I debated on the tie and decided I didn't have one that matched the blue in my hair so I changed everything to blood red.  Changing the nail polish was the hardest part but because it was fresh it was easy to use my power on it without damaging my nails.

So at 7:30 I left wearing my black jeans and dark gray dress shirt and the blood red tie.  I didn't put on a coat, the sleeves would work and I was going to be with Sage anyway so I was going to be fine.

I caught the train and I was still 15 minutes early when I knocked on Sage's front door with a single blue rose – well it was white, I made it blue.  He opened the door brushing his teeth with and stopped mid brush to stare at me.  He stared at me for three minutes.  I counted the seconds bitting my bottom lip waiting for him to finish his examination of my attire spinning a few times before he shook his head and let me in.

He rushed up stairs and I heard him swear as he kicked something.  He wasn't ready.  I wasn't worried we'd be late.  I knew Sage was going to be late.  He made the reservation.  He knew better than to make it for 8 pm.  I stood in the entry way and waited for him – a proper date.  We hadn't really had one of these before.  I could have followed him upstairs and watched him get dressed, but then we proably wouldn't make our reservation.

I looked at the pictures on the wall, not that they had changed since I was here last and looked at them.  But then I looked at the center of the frames adoring the wall and found a selfie Sage had taken of the two of us in Central park with Drake chasing butterflies in the background.  I stared at the picture for a long time.  

Sage cleared his throat and I turned to look at him and found my boyfriend standing at the base of the stairs in a pair of black dress pants and a white button down shirt with the top of blue shirt peaking through.  I was going to guess that underneath the dress shirt Sage was wearing a superman shirt.  

He took a step closer and adjusted the blood red tie and smiled.  "You look amazing."

I smiled at him. "You too love."  I nodded towards the picture, "How long you had that up here?"

Sage smiled.  "Since you left.  I missed seeing you, so I printed a picture to remind me of you everything I walked past it."

"Can I get a copy of that?"

Sage smiled, "Yeah.  I'll get one made up."

"After dinner, I want you to meet some people okay?  I said.

Sage laughed, "You mean Matt and Faelen?  I was wondering whenI'd meet them."

I nodded.  "Yeah, them.  Faelen needs pack, they can stay in the other spare room tonight.  I'll take Faelen to Adrian later have him inducted into the pack."

"There isn't any need to do that.  He's your pack mate, you induct him into your pack.  No one is going to dispute that Nox.  He's yours.  I'm yours.  Drake is yours.  I bet if you tried hard enough Matt would be yours too. I bet your lion friend could be yours too if you knew how to do it. If you haven't already."  Sage laughed.  "You have this uncanny ability to just do what you need to do to survive and help those around you survive."

"Can we not talk about all things mistical and mysterious about me tonight?"  I asked.

"Of course, Nox." He offered me his arm, "Shall we.  We have reservations."

And we went, we weren't late – we were early even.  I smiled happily as the maitrade sat us down at a table for two in the dimly light Italian restaruant.  One I'd never been to.  Sage ordered for me.  Well he had ordered ahead of time, so everything was ready when we arrived.  

We chatted about nothing in particular.  All that really mattered was that I was with Sage, we were together and I was holding his hand.  Running my fingers over the top of his.  I don't know when the conversation stopped.  Our check sat in the middle of the table and Sage was watching me stare at him.  I knew he was watching by the way he chewed at his bottom lip.  He was memorizing me. He asked me, "Is everything okay?"

I nodded.  "Yes, love, perfect. I just missed you."

"I missed you too.  Last night…."  He frowned, "I'm sorry I didn't know what to do."

I gave him a weak smile. "You did nothing wrong.  You did everything you were supposed to.  I was beyond my capacity to cope."

He sighed.  "Nox.  You need to talk to Dr. Silverman."

I sighed.  "I will.  You made the appointment."  He nodded in agreement.  I continued, "But I will find someone else to talk to, Sage, other than you.  I'm not sure I could trust her again."

"Nox, she loves you.  Just like Dorian.  You forgave him."

"Sage, she tried to kill me.  But I don't really know that she even tried.  I think the Venatori had my sister killed and let me live.  Gary said they chose wrong." I could see Sage's demeanor change at the mention of the Venatori harming me in some way.  My love was over protective.  And I didn't blame him.  I was furious.  I pushed the data card across the table.  "I don't have the clearance to read the information on it.  But Dorian's mom gave me everything about my birth, my father, my mother, anything about me.  I don't know what's on it. But I think it's important."

Sage picked it up and smiled, "You want me to see if I can crack it?"

I shrugged. "I'm not asking you to.  If it's something you want to I won't stop you.  I'll see what friends I can find to unlock it, but that could take a while.  I don't know those people.  And I think only the top clearance will get me into those files."

Sage pocketed the card and smiled.  "I'll work on it."  The glint in his eye said that he was more than eager to hold it over the Venatori.  To know what he could to do make them pay.  

I smiled, "You want to meet Faelen and Matt and pick up all three boys.  I'll even let you spoil them with icecream on the way home."

Sage laughed.  "Will you eat some?"

I nodded, "I will for you love.  Anything you want."

Sage smiled. "I just want you, Nox.  Just you."



# Meeting the Boys

Date night was good. Nox was perfectly dressed I'd seen him in club wear before, but this this was spectacular. The blue rose was perfect. I had been disappointed he hadn't followed me back up stairs. I'd have been late for our reservation if I could have taken him out of his clothes. But I wasn't going to get to have fun with Nox tonight – we had not one but three boys staying with us and two of them were old enough to know what went on behind closed doors.

We walked from the restaurant to the AU building – hand in hand and stealing small glances at each other when the other wasn't looking. The talk was easy and pretty non-essential, there was a long stretch of silence that wasn't awkward. It made me wonder how thing had gotten to this point, where we were comfortable even when there was nothing to say. He'd been gone for two weeks. It was supposed to be a month but the trip ended abruptly and here Nox was walking with me.

When the AU building drew into sight Nox pulled me aside and into the shadows of the building, he pulled me against him as he leaned on the wall. His hands on my hips he smiled at me. I loved that smile. I brushed a red strand from his face and put my arms around his neck. I waited for him to say something but he just stared at me. I asked, "What?"

"Nothing, love. I just missed looking at him." He quipped with a smirk on his face. I felt the blood rushing to my ears and face as he leaned forward and brushed his lips against mine then whispered, "I love that color on you." Which of course made it worse and he spoke softly again, "You sure you don't want to spend the night alone?"

I shook my head and stepped away from him. He was purposefully tempting me and he knew it. "You promised Drake he could spend the night at home."

He frowned but it was gone just as quickly as it had appeared and I wasn't sure if I'd even seen it. He was taking my hand and we walked towards the building and inside the public spaces to the elevator. There was no way I could walk all those stairs and Nox never even asked if I'd try, he pushed the button and we waited for it to come down. I could feel his palms starting to sweat, and his pulse quicken.

The elevator cleared and we were the only one's left on the elevator when it started up. Nox was wrapped around me, his face pressed against my neck. I think I enjoyed the elevator ride because of his reaction to it. He trembled in my arms as I held him tight against me. No one else joined us on the elevator. We got off in the dorms. I only knew it was the dorms because it was a long empty hall that lead into a set of double doors and I could hear a bunch of music playing and a lot of loud male voices.

Nox pushed opened the double doors and I was greeted with the sight of what a frat house might look like if there were kids of all ages in one. There was a pool table, a foozeball machine, several couches and a large flat screen. Tables and a small kitchenette. And a lot of boys. A man with gray hair and a pair of round reading glasses walked over to us and held out his hand. "Nox, my boy. A pleasure to see you."

"Good to see you again. This is Sage Morgan."

I took the man's proffered hand. "Nice to meet you Mr. Morgan."

"Sage is fine." I said quickly. The man laughed, and Nox nor he actually gave his name. A boy, with another held firmly in hand came up to Nox with a bag, in each of their free hands.

They smiled at me, one was shy and I felt the power of the wolf radiating off of him. He was the one being lead by the other, and if I'd not known it I would never have guess he was Venatori. Without the cross swords at his temple he looked like every other sixteen year old boy I'd ever met.

The man patted the Venatori boy on the shoulder, "Have fun, Matthew."

He grinned at the man and nodded. He offered me his hand with a bright smile. "I'm Matt." He nodded towards the other boy. "This is Faelen. You must be Sage."

I nodded. "I finally get a face to the name." He looked at me like he was confused and I laughed. "Nox wrote all about you. About both of you."

Matt chuckled. "That's right, he was always writing things down."

Nox was watching our exchange but he was watching the wolf boy more. He held out his hand and Faelen went to him immediately. Nox wrapped his arms around the boy and Faelen relaxed. I liked watching him with Drake and this was no different. I took Matt's bag, "Shall we go get Drake?"

Nox frowned a little then nodded. Seeing his father was never easy for him. But the frown was replaced by a grin and we were on our way, up the stairs this time up to see his father.

Kai answered the door holding Snoopy on his neck and a toddler under his arm like a sack of potatoes. He smiled brightly at me and bid us to come in. Drake squirmed and his poppi let him down and he ran and wrapped his arms around Nox with a huge smile. "You home."

Nox pulled the boy close and nodded, "Yeah. You want to go home?"

He nodded and Nox stood up and picked the boy up with him not that he had much choice Drake was all arms around Nox's neck. "Thank you, Kai for watching him."

"It's always my pleasure, Nox. Sage and I have plenty of time to talk too." He smiled at me and patted my shoulder. "Who are these two?"

Nox introduced the boys. "Matthew Davenport, Faelen Taylor, this is Kai Viddens, my father."

Matt extended his hand with a shy smile. "A pleasure, sir. I've read all about you. My mother spoke highly of you and Mr. Vega."

Faelen just curled around Nox's body like he was afraid of Nox's father. Kai wasn't an overly tall man, but he was imposing, and he was Venatori. There was a definite air of superiority wafting off of him while Matt spoke of his accolades.

Nox added, "Faelen will be staying with us. If he doesn't want to join the pack, we'll have to figure something else out."

Faelen muttered something I didn't quite hear, but Kai laughed, "No one will hurt you here little wolf, and I doubt my boy will let you go anywhere he suspects you'll get hurt."

Matt frowned, "There are already boys who have shown an interest in hurting Fae. He's not exactly substantial. He'll be better in a pack. Or a human school."

Faelen didn't react well either he looked wounded when Matt made his suggestion. Nox pulled the wolf closer and smiled at Matt, "We'll deal with it all later. I think Sage wanted to get ice-cream before we go. Dad, you want to come?"

Kai shook his head. "No, I'm going to call Margo now that you've gotten Drake and I owe her a dinner."

Nox nodded with a smile. "Enjoy your date. Some other time."

Kai smiled and kissed Drake on the cheek and offered the boys each a hand, "I look forward to spending time with the two of you." Matt grinned.

I gave Kai a hug and we all left the AU building via the stairs. Faelen was a lot less tense going down than I'd seen him so far. He was chasing Matt and Drake both down the railing. Nox watched as he walked down. I watched him. He was a beautiful man and I was never going to get over that. I snaked my fingers in his and we all went for ice-cream at Bonnie's across the street before heading home.

It was nice having a family. I knew what family was before. I love my family, but this was different. It was mine even if it was all so new.



# I Don't Know How To Tell You

It had been a few days since I'd been back and I'd avoided one person.  I'd seen Mia when picking up Drake and told her I'd talk with Jace later.  I didn't want to make it worse by waiting too long.  He'd hopefully understand why I didn't tell him right away.  But I didn't think he'd understand either way this went or when it went down.

Jace was cleaning up his classroom when I knocked on the door.  He looked up and he smiled out of habit.  But it faded with into anger as he looked back down at his desk.

I walked inside the room and shut the door behind me.  Jace said with a white hot voice, "You afraid I'm going to yell at you?"

I shook my head, "No.  I figured you'd rather keep some modecum of your calm cool collected reputation."

"That's thoughtful of you."  He said as he straightened a stack of papers a little rougher than was necessary.  He bent the stack several times before he huffed and put them down.  He looked up at me.  "Why did you let Chris die?"

"Yeah, Jace I let some fucking were just kill him.  He's like my own nephew. "

"But he's not your nephew.  He's mine.  You're nephew survived."  Jace stalked over to me where I stood halfway between him and the door.  He shoved me and I could feel the bruise form and almost immediately heal.  "You could have saved Chris too."

"I tried Jace.  I raced to them as fast I as I could.  You know I didn't know which ones were which on the screen you know how it works."  I spoke calmly and tried not to make things worse and I just stated facts.

"Don't Jace me.  You didn't try hard enough."  He shoved me.

"I'm sorry Jason.  Or would you prefer Mr. Hill?"  He shoved me harder and I had no choice but to take a step back.

"You could have saved him."  Another shove.  "You were so worried about every other boy."  Another shove and I took another step backwards.  "You saved a fucking were boy before you saved my brother's son." He shoved me again and I hit the wall behind me. I took a deep breath and squashed the rising fear, the overwhelming crushing pain that enveloped my chest as I started to panic.  I couldn't panic now.  Jace had every right to be angry and I'd rather he take it out on me than Fae or Matt or one of the other boys who survived. "Who the fuck do you think you are, saving monsters over your own kin."

"Chris was dead by the time I found the boy.  I found him first Jace.  I cried.  I was broken.  I couldn't do anything and I knew you'd hate me cause I let him die.  You think I don't wish I could have gotten to him faster."  I tried not to let my voice crack with the pain from the encounter and this very situation.  

He grabbed my shoulders and shoved me into the wall, I felt the drywall dent as my shoulders crashed into it.  I knew I was on the verge of a panic attack.  I tried to cont to ten backwards.  It didn't work.  My heart was in my throat.  I felt the tears fall silently down my cheeks, they burned my eyes and were warm against my skin.  Jace was yelling a torent of whys and hows and whos at me.  I couldn't focus on any of it.  I couldn't listen to him with my heart pounding in my ears.  

I didn't hear the door open but the next thing I knew Mia was ripping Jace's hands from my shoulders and he was staggering backwards.  I didn't hear Mia shouting over the rush of fear coursing through my body.  I stayed where I was, frozen in fear.  Caught up in the memories that flooded through me any time something like this triggered me.  

I remember standing in the fire starter room – behind the orange door with my hands to the wall and in my head Garrett was screaming at me.  I could feel the lashes of air and earth falling on my back around my arms over my shoulders, wrapping around me.  The pain of my skin ripping form my body was real.  Living my nightmares while I was awake was worse than in the dreams.  I could feel the pain and I would remember it.

There was a tender hand on my cheek wiping away the tears.  I heard a name through the jumble of noise in my body,  "Sage."

But I didn't register anything else as I sank to the floor and pulled my legs up to my chest.  I slowed my breathing, the hand still on my cheeks running small fingers over my beared, rubbing the hair and grabbing a small handful of manicured hair.  I glanced down at the small hand and the flood gates opened and the tears fell.  I sobbed, "I'm sorry."  I said it over and over again.

The small little girl was pulled from me and I reached for her but a strong hand grabbed my hand.  He pulled me into his lap and I curled up against him.  He whispered in my ear.  "I'm sorry, Nox.  I know you did everything you could.  I know.  I'm angry.  I'm not angry at you, babe.  It's okay.  I'm here.  We'll take you home.  I'm sorry."

There was a barrage of I'm sorries as he held me close.  He'd done it so many times before.  I calmed down but I don't know how many minutes had passed.  Mia was smiling at me when I looked up.  She asked, "You think you can walk?"

I nodded and she stood up and offered me here hand and I stood up with her's and Jace's assistance.  Mia handed me Naya and smiled, "You think you can walk and hold her?"

I nodded again and took the small one offered me.  She wrapped her arms around my neck and hugged me.  She murmurred in my ear baby nothings and I couldn't help but smile.  Jace turned me towards him.  "You are coming home with me right?"

I nodded.  "I wouldn't be anywhere else, babe."  He leaned in and pressed his lips to mine and kissed softly and hugged me to him with Naya craddled between us.  

Jace pulled away and took my hand.  Mia took his and she lead us through the door and towards the elevator.  They would take me to Sage.  I think I understood that from the barrage of things they said.  When did Sage's place become home I asked myself.



# Southern Hospitality

It had been a while since I'd been down south with Jace. Mia was home with the kids. All the kids. Faelen and Drake were staying with Mia and helping to take care of Naya. Matt was stuck in the AU building with classes. Fae wasn't enrolled in anything yet. That was one reason he was with Mia, he was looking towards human schools. Mia and Jace had a good one nearby. It would be a pain in the ass, he didn't seem to want to stay in Hell's Kitchen with Sage. Maybe he was afraid of the pack not being part of it. We hadn't had a chance to sit down and talk really.

Jace and I had flown down. Jace being the great man that he was held my hand the whole way. He sat by the window he consoled my fucking fears and he was the perfect friend. And after all that had happened, he'd forgiven me. I wasn't sure I'd forgive myself yet for Chris' death, but Jace had forgiven me. That was the biggest step I needed to take.

The funeral was a whole day affair. We stayed with Jace's parents in Jace's old room. We shared the twin bed like we had many times before. I startled awake early and rolled out of his embrace and felt the welts on my back and took care of things before anyone in the house stirred. Unlike home, I had breakfast ready before 5 when Mr. Hill came down to fetch the preset brewed coffee.

He looked at me and shook his head. "I always forget we can expect breakfast before the sun when you are here."

I smiled. "It's the least I can do for you in this time of loss. I've more than enough breakfast to feed the whole village if you need."

Mr. Hill laughed. "Son, we likely will."

I smiled. "Then I'll keep cooking. You and your wife have family to attend. People to see to. I got the food for the day. Everything."

Mrs Hill stepped into the kitchen on that last little bit and wrapped her arms around me. "Oh hunny, you don't need to do that. Me and the girls got it."

I shook my head. "No ma'am. I got this. Let me do this for you please."

Jace's brother came down stairs pulling on a purple jacket and a festive hat. I felt the tear run down my cheek before he was even in the room. He gave me that smile, so like Jace's. He said, "Mama, leave him be. Chris would want everyone in town spoiled by this one." Henry clapped me on the back and I felt another tear roll down my cheek. He pulled me in for a hug and whispered, "I know you did everything for my boy. I never once doubted it brother, unlike Jace who should know better."

I hugged him back and whispered back, "He has his reasons for doubting me."

Henry laughed and sighed at the same time. "He loves you more than he should, my little brother, but he always believes in you."

"I love him too, just…"

He patted my back and squeezed me, "He knows." He leaned away from me and took a strip of bacon from the platter. "He knows he's just too pig headed to care."

Jace was standing at the bottom of the stares with a wide grin and his middle finger sticking up, "I love you, too, Hen."

The nickname prompted Henry to wrap Jace up in a head lock and the Hill parents to tell the boys to take it outside which they did. But they greeted all the folks coming down into their yard.

Venatori funerals celebrate the life of a Venatori. A southern Venatori funeral took the celebration to a whole new level. There was the usual bonfires and party, but today the Hill house was Jazz central. They had several bands playing throughout the day. The dance floor was light up and would stay on fire until well into the night. The booze were free flowing.

There would be stories of Chris and his family. There would be stories of his family's legacy. There would be fun and sad all rolled into one, but they celebrated the death of their son.

To some it may seem outlandish, but for the Venatori, death came for us all. We knew this, we understood this, and if the universe took us from our family and friends it wasn't predestined or ordained. It was life.

There were Magnus present at every party. They maintained a certain discretion from the outside world. A veil not only of vision but of sound. But at a funeral they did other things too, one was returning the body to the universe. Being Cesari I attended more funerals as a child than I would have liked. But being Cesari I was often given the honor of returning the body to the universe while the rest of the party celebrated the life.

I had already done that for Chris. I'd given him his burial. I'd burned his body and I sent him back. I brought the ashes back so the ceremony could be preformed, so those in attendance would get to say there goodbyes and witness the magic of life returning to the ether. No one ever saw what I did, I had asked on many occasion what other's saw. The patterns around the ashes when dispersed with magic flitted and floated by the visible eye. The winds of the magic taking the ashes away but hat wasn't what I saw. The ash turned to lights, turned to life itself. I'd seen the sparkling lights when I first started digging into the healing with the elements. Between each thread, each weave of a pattern between everything was life, that tiny spark that made the universe tick. It was this sparkle that allowed me to heal. But if you tried to force it, it burnt out. You had to let life do it's thing of it's own free will. It made us up. It gave us life, and it stayed with our bodies as we died unless we let it go back to where it came from. Human's return the bodies to the earth. Vampires turn to dust, the life gone from their bodies when they died. They burn up their life force the longer they live after death. Therians burn their bodies to keep the taint from spreading to others. Everything returns to whence it came.

It was more beautiful than the fireworks that were going off during the ceremony. Jace wrapped his arm around my waist behind the barbecue pit I was manning. "You need to draw what you see babe. Someone will believe you one day."

I laughed. "Someone believes me now."
