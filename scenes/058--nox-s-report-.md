# Nox's Report

The whole incident in the mountains didn't require a report.  It wasn't a hunting job but I still filed one. 

It wasn't much â€“ well it was.  I filed a report dealing with day 1 to day end.  Which included notes on everything, and I gave them a link to the online blog thing Sage set up so they could read it in detail.  

I made notes on Dylan, Michaela and Trent.  Kenny I hadn't had much info on.  I wasn't even sure his body made it back from Colorado for a burial.  But that's on Mick and Dylan.

I wrote down all the information that I knew about the coalition that Darwynn ran.  I didn't know much but I put what I knew from Darwynn, and Faelen.

I reported on Faelen and made the formal request for his adoption in the same report.  I just used the same forms Dorian had filled out for Drake and hoped that was all I needed to do.  The boy was 16 and he didn't want to leave mine or Matt's side.

I also put in a request to mentor Matt officiallly.  All these things were included in my report.  

There was an immediate response upon it's submission.  Dae'lin sent me an email.  "Gary wants to talk to you asap!"  I left out the bits that Darwynn had told me, about all the little secret killings.  How they knew, how it was timed.  How it wasn't an accident. I wanted Gary to call me in.  I wanted to call him out on his hypocracy.  I wanted to tell him he was a bastard for killing boys like that.  He fucking sent my best friends nephew to die!  He sent my nephew to die.

But I wasn't going to go immediately. I wasn't an errand boy to do Gary's bidding, but I wasn't going make Dae'lin angry either.  There was a fine line here.  I couldn't piss them both off.
