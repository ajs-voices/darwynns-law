I had a lot of time to think on my walk back.  I had a lot of time.  Dylan said I was sent here when they asked for help with all the kids dying around this time.  Gary sent me.  Darwynn said they send everyone here to die, so why did Dylan ask for a hunter?  He didn't want to die?  Or was this a set up?  Either way, these boys were all slated to die by the Venatori.  I was certain of that.  Why send anyone when you knew they always died.  

I hate the Venatori.  I truly do.  Barbaric and cruel and that's not even starting in on this particular deed.  Sacrificing kids!  That was not something I was going to tolerate.  Not even James and John deserved to die.

I walked back to camp and I collapsed on my bedroll and I tried to sleep but my head kept rolling so here I am talking to you.  Getting everything out of my head before I try to get some sleep.

I'm not sure there is anything I can do, other than save as many of these kids as I possibly can. I don't know if the strict orders were to stand, or really I was fucked.  I can't think I'm going to bed.
