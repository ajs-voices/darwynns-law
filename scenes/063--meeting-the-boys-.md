# Meeting the Boys

Date night was good. Nox was perfectly dressed I'd seen him in club wear before, but this this was spectacular. The blue rose was perfect. I had been disappointed he hadn't followed me back up stairs. I'd have been late for our reservation if I could have taken him out of his clothes. But I wasn't going to get to have fun with Nox tonight – we had not one but three boys staying with us and two of them were old enough to know what went on behind closed doors.

We walked from the restaurant to the AU building – hand in hand and stealing small glances at each other when the other wasn't looking. The talk was easy and pretty non-essential, there was a long stretch of silence that wasn't awkward. It made me wonder how thing had gotten to this point, where we were comfortable even when there was nothing to say. He'd been gone for two weeks. It was supposed to be a month but the trip ended abruptly and here Nox was walking with me.

When the AU building drew into sight Nox pulled me aside and into the shadows of the building, he pulled me against him as he leaned on the wall. His hands on my hips he smiled at me. I loved that smile. I brushed a red strand from his face and put my arms around his neck. I waited for him to say something but he just stared at me. I asked, "What?"

"Nothing, love. I just missed looking at him." He quipped with a smirk on his face. I felt the blood rushing to my ears and face as he leaned forward and brushed his lips against mine then whispered, "I love that color on you." Which of course made it worse and he spoke softly again, "You sure you don't want to spend the night alone?"

I shook my head and stepped away from him. He was purposefully tempting me and he knew it. "You promised Drake he could spend the night at home."

He frowned but it was gone just as quickly as it had appeared and I wasn't sure if I'd even seen it. He was taking my hand and we walked towards the building and inside the public spaces to the elevator. There was no way I could walk all those stairs and Nox never even asked if I'd try, he pushed the button and we waited for it to come down. I could feel his palms starting to sweat, and his pulse quicken.

The elevator cleared and we were the only one's left on the elevator when it started up. Nox was wrapped around me, his face pressed against my neck. I think I enjoyed the elevator ride because of his reaction to it. He trembled in my arms as I held him tight against me. No one else joined us on the elevator. We got off in the dorms. I only knew it was the dorms because it was a long empty hall that lead into a set of double doors and I could hear a bunch of music playing and a lot of loud male voices.

Nox pushed opened the double doors and I was greeted with the sight of what a frat house might look like if there were kids of all ages in one. There was a pool table, a foozeball machine, several couches and a large flat screen. Tables and a small kitchenette. And a lot of boys. A man with gray hair and a pair of round reading glasses walked over to us and held out his hand. "Nox, my boy. A pleasure to see you."

"Good to see you again. This is Sage Morgan."

I took the man's proffered hand. "Nice to meet you Mr. Morgan."

"Sage is fine." I said quickly. The man laughed, and Nox nor he actually gave his name. A boy, with another held firmly in hand came up to Nox with a bag, in each of their free hands.

They smiled at me, one was shy and I felt the power of the wolf radiating off of him. He was the one being lead by the other, and if I'd not known it I would never have guess he was Venatori. Without the cross swords at his temple he looked like every other sixteen year old boy I'd ever met.

The man patted the Venatori boy on the shoulder, "Have fun, Matthew."

He grinned at the man and nodded. He offered me his hand with a bright smile. "I'm Matt." He nodded towards the other boy. "This is Faelen. You must be Sage."

I nodded. "I finally get a face to the name." He looked at me like he was confused and I laughed. "Nox wrote all about you. About both of you."

Matt chuckled. "That's right, he was always writing things down."

Nox was watching our exchange but he was watching the wolf boy more. He held out his hand and Faelen went to him immediately. Nox wrapped his arms around the boy and Faelen relaxed. I liked watching him with Drake and this was no different. I took Matt's bag, "Shall we go get Drake?"

Nox frowned a little then nodded. Seeing his father was never easy for him. But the frown was replaced by a grin and we were on our way, up the stairs this time up to see his father.

Kai answered the door holding Snoopy on his neck and a toddler under his arm like a sack of potatoes. He smiled brightly at me and bid us to come in. Drake squirmed and his poppi let him down and he ran and wrapped his arms around Nox with a huge smile. "You home."

Nox pulled the boy close and nodded, "Yeah. You want to go home?"

He nodded and Nox stood up and picked the boy up with him not that he had much choice Drake was all arms around Nox's neck. "Thank you, Kai for watching him."

"It's always my pleasure, Nox. Sage and I have plenty of time to talk too." He smiled at me and patted my shoulder. "Who are these two?"

Nox introduced the boys. "Matthew Davenport, Faelen Taylor, this is Kai Viddens, my father."

Matt extended his hand with a shy smile. "A pleasure, sir. I've read all about you. My mother spoke highly of you and Mr. Vega."

Faelen just curled around Nox's body like he was afraid of Nox's father. Kai wasn't an overly tall man, but he was imposing, and he was Venatori. There was a definite air of superiority wafting off of him while Matt spoke of his accolades.

Nox added, "Faelen will be staying with us. If he doesn't want to join the pack, we'll have to figure something else out."

Faelen muttered something I didn't quite hear, but Kai laughed, "No one will hurt you here little wolf, and I doubt my boy will let you go anywhere he suspects you'll get hurt."

Matt frowned, "There are already boys who have shown an interest in hurting Fae. He's not exactly substantial. He'll be better in a pack. Or a human school."

Faelen didn't react well either he looked wounded when Matt made his suggestion. Nox pulled the wolf closer and smiled at Matt, "We'll deal with it all later. I think Sage wanted to get ice-cream before we go. Dad, you want to come?"

Kai shook his head. "No, I'm going to call Margo now that you've gotten Drake and I owe her a dinner."

Nox nodded with a smile. "Enjoy your date. Some other time."

Kai smiled and kissed Drake on the cheek and offered the boys each a hand, "I look forward to spending time with the two of you." Matt grinned.

I gave Kai a hug and we all left the AU building via the stairs. Faelen was a lot less tense going down than I'd seen him so far. He was chasing Matt and Drake both down the railing. Nox watched as he walked down. I watched him. He was a beautiful man and I was never going to get over that. I snaked my fingers in his and we all went for ice-cream at Bonnie's across the street before heading home.

It was nice having a family. I knew what family was before. I love my family, but this was different. It was mine even if it was all so new.
