Darwyn came back with his buck, the boys helped him cook it and we ate well outside the ruined village.  I buried as many of the bodies I could.  Matt and Faelen helped me.  Respecting the dead of our fallen foes.  All of the boys filtered off into their little cliques.  The teams didn't stick together, it was their friends and nothing but their friends.  Even my group of boys who had worked together were all sitting alone.  Life went on, and they were waiting on me to take them back.  

Now that we have everything buttoned up here.  No forest fires, no corpses to be scavenged and stumbled upon by humans, we headed for Boulder.
