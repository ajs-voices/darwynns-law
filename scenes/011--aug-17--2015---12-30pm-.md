We are on lunch break and the boys were taught and all three groups found the creek that was a mile's hike from camp.  We informed them of the situation.  The pool was for swimming but not drinking.   And water was up out of the pool for drinking.  I doubted the boys would walk a mile just to bathe most boys didn't care.  Though they all took it upon themselves to throw each other into to the pool.  John was the only of the boys who didn't know how to swim and when Brock threw him in there was some major flailing and lots of laughing before Dylan dove in and got the boy.

I couldn't help the memories that flooded into my brain.  I'm not interested in Dylan.  But the unrequited love never actually goes away.  Dylan may be cute, and he may be well cut… dan he's well cut but he's not Sage.  Two days in and I'm already missing my love.  This is going to be hell.  It might be prudent to keep my eyes averted when everyone else is playing in the water.  I didn't seem to be the only one avoiding the group, Matt came down and sat with me, I'm going to be the good listener and shut this for a bit.
