# I Missed You

I had plenty of time to kill before I was to meet up with Sage at 8.  I saw Drake for the first time and told him I would come get him at Poppi's place so that he could sleep with us tonight.  I hoped Sage didn't mind.  I sent him a text asking him to make sure I wasn't making promises I couldn't keep.  He responded with a resounding of course.  

And then I stopped in to see Matt and Faelen.  They were off in their own little world in the common room of the boys dorms.  Faelen was curled up against Matt while Matt read a book.  Faelen picked his eyes up when I knelt down next to them and he gave me a happy smile.  "Do you want to stay with pack tonight?"

He smiled and gave me a nod.  I looked at Matt who was smile.  "You want to come spend the night with him at Sage's?"

Matt nodded, "I'll see if I can get a pass from my Dad.  He seems overly eager to please me since I came back."

"You lived.  That means a lot.  And I'm sure he got word of my glowing report about your actions."  

Matt laughed.  "I guess.  I heard you got yelled at."

I shrugged.  "Nothing new.  I'm going to dinner with Sage at 8. We'll stop by afterwards and you can meet the rest of the family."

Matt smiled, "Am I part of that family then?"

I nodded.  "Yeah, Matt you are.  You might not be mine on paper but you'll be family none-the-less."

He brightened.  "I'll keep him safe till you come back for us then."

I patted him on the head and ruffled his hair. "I know you will."

With all of that taken care of I still had time for a shower, to change the color of my hair from the camo to sapphire blue, paint my nails the same matching color and put on a pair of black jeans and the only dress shirt I owned.  I debated on the tie and decided I didn't have one that matched the blue in my hair so I changed everything to blood red.  Changing the nail polish was the hardest part but because it was fresh it was easy to use my power on it without damaging my nails.

So at 7:30 I left wearing my black jeans and dark gray dress shirt and the blood red tie.  I didn't put on a coat, the sleeves would work and I was going to be with Sage anyway so I was going to be fine.

I caught the train and I was still 15 minutes early when I knocked on Sage's front door with a single blue rose – well it was white, I made it blue.  He opened the door brushing his teeth with and stopped mid brush to stare at me.  He stared at me for three minutes.  I counted the seconds bitting my bottom lip waiting for him to finish his examination of my attire spinning a few times before he shook his head and let me in.

He rushed up stairs and I heard him swear as he kicked something.  He wasn't ready.  I wasn't worried we'd be late.  I knew Sage was going to be late.  He made the reservation.  He knew better than to make it for 8 pm.  I stood in the entry way and waited for him – a proper date.  We hadn't really had one of these before.  I could have followed him upstairs and watched him get dressed, but then we proably wouldn't make our reservation.

I looked at the pictures on the wall, not that they had changed since I was here last and looked at them.  But then I looked at the center of the frames adoring the wall and found a selfie Sage had taken of the two of us in Central park with Drake chasing butterflies in the background.  I stared at the picture for a long time.  

Sage cleared his throat and I turned to look at him and found my boyfriend standing at the base of the stairs in a pair of black dress pants and a white button down shirt with the top of blue shirt peaking through.  I was going to guess that underneath the dress shirt Sage was wearing a superman shirt.  

He took a step closer and adjusted the blood red tie and smiled.  "You look amazing."

I smiled at him. "You too love."  I nodded towards the picture, "How long you had that up here?"

Sage smiled.  "Since you left.  I missed seeing you, so I printed a picture to remind me of you everything I walked past it."

"Can I get a copy of that?"

Sage smiled, "Yeah.  I'll get one made up."

"After dinner, I want you to meet some people okay?  I said.

Sage laughed, "You mean Matt and Faelen?  I was wondering whenI'd meet them."

I nodded.  "Yeah, them.  Faelen needs pack, they can stay in the other spare room tonight.  I'll take Faelen to Adrian later have him inducted into the pack."

"There isn't any need to do that.  He's your pack mate, you induct him into your pack.  No one is going to dispute that Nox.  He's yours.  I'm yours.  Drake is yours.  I bet if you tried hard enough Matt would be yours too. I bet your lion friend could be yours too if you knew how to do it. If you haven't already."  Sage laughed.  "You have this uncanny ability to just do what you need to do to survive and help those around you survive."

"Can we not talk about all things mistical and mysterious about me tonight?"  I asked.

"Of course, Nox." He offered me his arm, "Shall we.  We have reservations."

And we went, we weren't late – we were early even.  I smiled happily as the maitrade sat us down at a table for two in the dimly light Italian restaruant.  One I'd never been to.  Sage ordered for me.  Well he had ordered ahead of time, so everything was ready when we arrived.  

We chatted about nothing in particular.  All that really mattered was that I was with Sage, we were together and I was holding his hand.  Running my fingers over the top of his.  I don't know when the conversation stopped.  Our check sat in the middle of the table and Sage was watching me stare at him.  I knew he was watching by the way he chewed at his bottom lip.  He was memorizing me. He asked me, "Is everything okay?"

I nodded.  "Yes, love, perfect. I just missed you."

"I missed you too.  Last night…."  He frowned, "I'm sorry I didn't know what to do."

I gave him a weak smile. "You did nothing wrong.  You did everything you were supposed to.  I was beyond my capacity to cope."

He sighed.  "Nox.  You need to talk to Dr. Silverman."

I sighed.  "I will.  You made the appointment."  He nodded in agreement.  I continued, "But I will find someone else to talk to, Sage, other than you.  I'm not sure I could trust her again."

"Nox, she loves you.  Just like Dorian.  You forgave him."

"Sage, she tried to kill me.  But I don't really know that she even tried.  I think the Venatori had my sister killed and let me live.  Gary said they chose wrong." I could see Sage's demeanor change at the mention of the Venatori harming me in some way.  My love was over protective.  And I didn't blame him.  I was furious.  I pushed the data card across the table.  "I don't have the clearance to read the information on it.  But Dorian's mom gave me everything about my birth, my father, my mother, anything about me.  I don't know what's on it. But I think it's important."

Sage picked it up and smiled, "You want me to see if I can crack it?"

I shrugged. "I'm not asking you to.  If it's something you want to I won't stop you.  I'll see what friends I can find to unlock it, but that could take a while.  I don't know those people.  And I think only the top clearance will get me into those files."

Sage pocketed the card and smiled.  "I'll work on it."  The glint in his eye said that he was more than eager to hold it over the Venatori.  To know what he could to do make them pay.  

I smiled, "You want to meet Faelen and Matt and pick up all three boys.  I'll even let you spoil them with icecream on the way home."

Sage laughed.  "Will you eat some?"

I nodded, "I will for you love.  Anything you want."

Sage smiled. "I just want you, Nox.  Just you."
