Sage found the journal I kept when I left home for the first time.  The journal that Margo made me keep while I hunted with Michaela.  The whole I couldn't talk to her like I could while I lived in the AU Building.  It helped.  Since I've not been to see Margo since I found out she was a dragon, or that she killed my twin sister as a baby, or tried to kill me Sage thinks it's a good idea to do this now - particularly since I won't be able to talk to him as easily being away.  

Ironically I'll be going back to the Rocky Mountains, where I grew up, where I went with Michaela, and where my mother died.  Where everything begins and ends for me.  The irony of it all is not lost on me.  Friday, Dae'lin told me that I was going to go out with one of the survival groups and be a teacher.  Which okay I can handle, but then she told me who I was going with - Dylan Reed.

Just fucking great!  What I needed was the one guy I avoided for most of my life in the Academy.  Sage laughed when I told him I was avoiding him and why.  I avoided Dylan so he could avoid me better.  The last thing the uber popular swim captain wanted was some gay groupie following him around.  Particularly one who kissed him.

Dylan proceeded to give me a beat down after that so I guess we were even.  But I avoided him to avoid further damage to my body.

Anyway, back to why I'm writing this.  I'm going to be away from Sage for 30 days straight.  This is the going to be the longest I've been away from him.  And the longest I've gone without therapy my entire life.  This is to be my therapy for the next thirty days.  Except this time my boyfriend souped up my phone with his awesome technopath ability.  He says I can use the internet anywhere in the world now.  I suppose he'd know.  He says the cell service might suck but my internet won't.

And in that vein he set up this blog for me to keep a journal of all the things that happen to me while I'm out.  He also set up Twitter and Instagram so I can keep things going in micro bursts and images internet style.  I'm not sure how I feel about sharing my life with the world. But I trust Sage.  So I'll do this.
