I didn't really sleep.  Larry got a few a hours of sleep though, he was doing better.  

We headed to the dot farthest away.  And we caught up to him about lunch time.   Patrick was bleeding.  He wasn't bitten thankfully.  Scratched and mauled but not bitten.  I don't know how he got away.  But he was a live.  

"Tell me what happened Patrick."  I instructed while I wrapped him up in the elements so that he could heal faster.  Supernatural wounds were always slow to heal, and therian scratches are one of the hardest.

Patrick started.  "They came out of no where."  He looked up at me.  "Chris was at the back of the line.  He stood no chance as they attacked.  He was the first one down.  The rest of us scattered. I don't know what happened to the others.  One followed me.  He corned me.  But I shot him in the head.  It didn't kill him.  He was still breathing when I ran.  But I didn't think about it."

Larry asked, "How many where there?"

"Three maybe four."

"They got John too."  Larry said.

Our plan was sit still until the others came to us.  I threw up a wall of air and I leaned against a tree to take a nap.  I left my senses wide and hoped that the boys would be equipped if anything attacked.  But they had to get past the wall first.
