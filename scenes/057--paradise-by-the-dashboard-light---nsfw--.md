# Paradise by the Dashboard Light? (NSFW)

Sage carried my things inside and took them upstairs to his room.  He was grinning like a fool.  My things were finally almost completely in his house now.  

I didn't take off my clothes as I plopped down on his bed.  Sage touched my face and smiled down at me.  "You okay?"

I shook my head.  "No love, I'm not.  I need you."

He smiled brightly at me, "I'm not going anywhere."

I fell back on the bed and pulled Sage by his shirt with me.  His body pressed mine into the mattress and I kissed his neck then whispered into his ear, "You misunderstand.  I need you, love.  I need you inside me.  I need you."  

Sage's body shuddered on top of me, "I thought you'd never ask."  He pressed his lips to my mouth and his tongue slide between my lips.  Things we'd done countless times before, but today, tonight they felt electric.  He pressed himself between my legs and ground his hips into mine.  He was hard against me and I felt my own cock twitch at the contact.

We kissed and ground against each other, finding the rhythm that we both liked.  His hot wet mouth against my neck made me moan.  I quivered underneath him.  My fingers found the hem of his t-shirt and I was pulling his shirt over his head.  He broke our kiss and Sage sat up, his legs spread around me and he looked at me.  

His eyes were dark with desire, the perfect blue I'd never seen in his eyes before.  My fingers played with the skin above his jeans at his hips as he unbuttoned them, and slide from the bed to remove them.  I sat up on my elbows and stared across my body at my love, naked in all his glory.  He wasn't overly muscled, but his body had good definition for a man who sat at a computer all day.  His abs looked amazing and the trail of hair down from his belly button was so fucking hot, I just wanted to lick all the way down until he was in my mouth.

Sage tugged at my shoes and pulled my jeans off.  He smiled down at me as he crawled back on top of me and pulled at my shirt.  I lifted my body so he could ease it past my shoulder blades.  His lips found mine once they were clear of my t-shirt but he stopped there, pinning my arms above my head.  I let out a soft moan as he played with the skin at my neck before he went down to my collar bone and left small nips before moving even farther down.  

His lips trailed kisses down until he was mouthing my cock through my boxers.  

In one quick movement Sage had them off and was back licking my cock.  Spreading my legs so he could put my balls in his mouth.  His tongue ravaging everything he could touch until he was running his tongue against my hole.  I squirmed and groaned as he slide it inside.  

I writhed under his ministrations as he slid a finger inside and took my cock in his mouth.  I almost came then.  But I took a few deep breathes and calmed myself.  "You don't need to do that love."  I breathed through moans as he found that one spot that made me see stars.  

He hummed his ascent and I had to fight the urge to release before he even got half way through with getting me ready.  He slid a second one inside and was fucking me and sucking on me and I wanted to â€“ needed to.  With a slurping sound everything ceased and there was quiet and agnoy.  I couldn't see my love.  There was a moment of panic before I heard the tell tale signs of foil being ripped open.  Sage leaned over on the side of the bed and kissed me hard.  "I'm here love.  I'm not going to leave you."

He walked back around and I felt him crawl on the bed.  He reached up and pulled the t-shirt the remainder of the way off.  He smiled at me before he kissed me again licking my lips in parting when he sat up.  I watched as he slid the condom on his cock and applied lube.  He didn't wait long before he was pressing the head of his cock against my rim.  The pressure was intense.  I groaned at the intrusion.  I bit my lip hard as he puhsed inside so slowly.  I didn't know if was trying not to hurt me or to make it agonizingly painful in that glorious way.  Either way it felt fucking wonderful and when he was fully engaged he leaned down and kissed me hard, our tongues  entwining together.  Sage drank down my moan when he shifted do he could pull out.  I gasped when he pushed inside again biting his lip.

Sage moved slowly above me.  I thrust up meeting my love and he chuckled in my ear.  "So eager."

I whispered, "Harder."

He bit my neck and slammed his cock inside of me several times before he slowed and pulled out and pushed inside just as slowly.  I whined and Sage grinned down at me. I writhed under him.  He sat up and grabbed my legs and pulled me up into him.  The first thrust inside left me breathless.  But Sage continental hard and fast until we were both breathing hard.  He pumped again and his body shook with orgasm. I felt him pulse and I lost it seconds after him and spurt over my stomach.   Sage collapsed on top of me heedless of the mess.  He kissed me hard and I felt every last emotion drain out of me I wrapped my arms tight around my love and cried.  There was no questions he just held me till I could explain.  But that didn't come till morning. We fell asleep wrapped in ear others arms naked.  I didn't dream anything other than about my love.  I had no flee reaction.  I loved him.  More than I could ever fucking tell him.
